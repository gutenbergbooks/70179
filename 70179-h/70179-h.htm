</div>


<p>The main ideas underlying the treatment here found of English
orthography were embodied in an article which appeared in the
<i>Atlantic Monthly</i> for June, 1907. The title it there bore
was “Confessions of a Spelling Reformer.” This it was the original
intention to give to the present work. But with the changes which were
required in recasting the article upon which it was based, with the
great expansion of many of the points considered in it, more than all
with the extension of its scope so as to include many new topics, the
personal element which had characterized it none too prominently in the
first place sank into almost complete insignificance. Hence followed
the inappropriateness of the title. Here, accordingly, it has been
confined to the opening chapter, and for it has been substituted that
which the volume now bears.</p>

<p>As published in the magazine, the article referred to was of a length
so unconscionable that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span> I have always been confident that the editor,
however carefully he concealed his feelings, groaned inwardly at the
space he obliged himself to give up to it. Still, long as it was, much
which had been prepared for it was cut out before transmission. It
was felt that there is a point beyond which the patience of the most
long-suffering of editors will not stretch. A few passages which were
then omitted were later made to do service in a presidential address
given at the annual meeting of the Simplified Spelling Board. These
have been restored here, though in a much enlarged form, to their
old place. With them also has been reinstated a good deal of other
matter which had been struck out before the article was forwarded for
publication. I have also made use of several paragraphs which had
appeared a number of years ago in contributions to the <i>Century
Magazine</i>. In addition, it is to be said that one whole chapter
in the volume has been printed before, though very much abbreviated,
in <i>Harper’s Magazine</i>. But in spite of the extent to which I
have drawn upon matter previously published, fully two-thirds of the
contents of the present treatise has never up to this time appeared in
print. This is true in particular of what in my own eyes is the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
important chapter in the book—that on the Orthographic Situation.</p>

<p>The subject of spelling reform is not, strictly speaking, a
soul-stirring one, nor is any possible treatment of it likely to
contribute to the gayety of nations. If any of the chapters contained
in the present volume be of the slightest interest in itself, that
on the orthographic situation is assuredly not the one. On the other
hand, if there be anything of value in the work, that same chapter
has, as I look at it, far the most value. There is in it, indeed,
nothing original. The numerous facts it contains are to be found
scattered up and down the pages of various volumes—particularly in
the introductions to the larger dictionaries, and in orthographic and
orthoepic essays produced at various periods. But so far as I know,
this is the first attempt ever made to collect and combine and, above
all, to put in a form, easily comprehensible by the general reader,
the widely scattered facts which go to show the precise character
and characteristics of English orthography, and to bring out with
distinctness the real nature of the deep-seated disease under which it
labors.</p>

<p>At all events, whether or not I have been anticipated in the
presentation of these facts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span> such knowledge of them as can be gained
from this volume or from some better source is essential to the
comprehension of the subject or to any proper consideration of it.
Designedly and avowedly incomplete as is the survey of the subject
here taken, it is sufficiently detailed to give any one who cares to
understand it a fair degree of familiarity with the situation which
confronts him who sets out to effect a genuine and not a spurious
reform. It is furthermore sufficient to give him a fair conception of
the sort of work that will have to be done before the anarchy which now
prevails in our spelling can give way to even the semblance of order.</p>

<p>Assuredly there was ample need of a work of this sort being prepared,
and the only regret that need be entertained is that it has not fallen
to some one better equipped than myself to prepare it. For I reiterate
in this preface what I have said in the body of the work itself: that
there is no one subject upon which men, whether presumably or really
intelligent, are in a state of more hopeless, helpless ignorance
than upon that of the nature and history of English orthography. No
serious student of it can read the articles which appear in newspapers,
the communications sent to them, or the elaborate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span> essays found in
periodicals, without being struck by the more than Egyptian darkness
which prevails. In nearly every one of these mistakes of fact not
merely exist but abound. Most of the assertions made lack even that
decent degree of probability which belongs to respectable fiction. Even
in the very few cases where the facts are correct, the inferences drawn
from them are utterly erroneous and misleading. Many of these articles,
too, contain mistakes of apprehension so gross that one comes to feel
that in the discussion of this particular subject the limits of human
incapacity to understand the simplest assertion have been reached.
Statements of this sort will be resented with all the venomousness of
anonymous personal vituperation. They have not been made, however,
without full examination of scores and scores of articles which have
come out in opposition to spelling reform. No difficulty will be found,
if the occasion demands, to substantiate their correctness beyond the
shadow of a doubt.</p>

<p>The various chapters contained in this volume follow one another in
logical sequence. But I have also sought to make each of them, in a
way, independent of the others, and therefore complete in itself. This
has necessitated, in a very few cases, the repetition of statements
important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span> only for the immediate understanding of the particular
subject. I may venture to add that I have taken great pains to make the
numerous details scattered through the volume absolutely correct, so
that he who quarrels with the conclusions reached may have no cause to
question the facts upon which they are based. If in the immense mass
of these found here I have made anywhere a slip, I shall be grateful
for the detection of it, and none the less so if it come from the most
hostile source. In this subject it is the exact truth of which we are
in pursuit, and a real though not a fancied exposure of error is to be
welcomed gladly.</p>

<p>The movement now going on for the simplification of English spelling
has in the few years of its existence attained a success which has
never been even remotely approached by any similar attempt in the past.
This has been due, in part, to the fact that an effort for reform
has for the first time had behind it the support of an organized
propaganda. Previous undertakings of the sort have been mainly the
work of individuals. It has likewise been due, in part, to the general
spread of knowledge as to the nature and history of words belonging to
our speech and the changes of form they have undergone. Something also
is due to the growing dissatisfaction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span> a consequence of this increase
of intelligence, with the anomalies and absurdities of the present
spelling, and the loss of time and labor, the waste of money, and the
mental injury which the acquisition of these perverse and perverted
forms involves. In our country, also, this feeling of dissatisfaction
has been strengthened by the consideration that something must be done
to remove from the path of that mighty army of foreigners landing
yearly upon our shores the greatest of the stumbling-blocks in the way
of the acquisition of the English language, necessary as the knowledge
of it is to any comprehension by them of the laws and institutions and
political ideas of the land they are henceforth to make their home.</p>

<p>Flourishing as the present movement assuredly is, it of course may fail
ultimately, as have several which have preceded it. It certainly will
fail if the propaganda does not continue to be vigorously pressed. It
will fail if proposals are adopted and methods are followed which,
while pleasing sciolists, do not recommend themselves to scholars.
That experiment has been too often tried to leave us in any doubt as
to the result. But whatever be the success or failure which may attend
the present movement, none the less am I confident that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span> English
race will not be content to sit down forever with a system of spelling
which has nothing to recommend it but custom and prejudice, nothing to
defend it but ignorance, nothing but superstition to make it an object
of veneration. An orthography which defies the main object for which
orthography was created cannot continue, with the advance of knowledge,
to be endured forever; for speaking with absolute reverence, it can be
said of it that, not being of God, it cannot stand.</p>

ENGLISH SPELLING AND<br>
SPELLING REFORM<br>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br><span class="small">CONFESSIONS OF A SPELLING REFORMER</span></h2></div>


<p>It was my fortune in 1906 to be wandering in lands where English is not
spoken, when the President of the United States issued his famous order
in regard to spelling. Little, therefore, of the comment it occasioned
met my eyes, either at the time or long after; little of the clamor
it excited reached my ears. But after my return to my own country I
had the opportunity to look over no small number of the productions
which came out in opposition to it or in criticism of it, whether they
appeared in the form of reported interviews with prominent persons, of
leaders in newspapers or letters to them, or of elaborate articles in
periodicals. Most of these written pieces were anonymous;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span> but some of
them came avowedly from men of recognized eminence in various fields of
intellectual activity.</p>

<p>It is with no intention of conveying the slightest suggestion of
disparagement of the authors of these various articles that I say that
not one of them contained a single argument which every person who has
paid even a superficial attention to the history of English orthography
has not been familiar with from the time of his first entering upon
the study. Even the jokes and sarcastic remarks of the newspapers were
hoary with the rime of age. In the case of these latter something must
be conceded to the inherent difficulty of the attack, without imputing
the feebleness of it, or the lack of originality in it, to mere
barrenness of brain. From the very nature of things it is hard to be
jocose upon a subject of which one knows nothing at all. A difficulty
of a like nature attended the production of the arguments which were
put forth seriously. They brought forward no new ideas; they simply
inspired recollections. It is only the fact that the writers of the
more elaborate articles seemed to regard the reasons they advanced as
novel, if not startling, contributions to thought, which to the mind of
the veteran of orthographical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span> wars imparted a certain languid interest
to what they said. One comes, in truth, to feel a sort of respect for
the continuous incapacity to comprehend the exact nature of the problem
presented, which year after year of discussion does not impair, nor
affluence of argument disturb.</p>

<p>As in a number of the pieces I was privileged to see I found my own
name mentioned, I trust it will not be deemed a mark of offensive
egotism—egotism of one sort it assuredly is—if I take the occasion of
its appearance in these articles to state my views exactly on various
points connected with the subject instead of having them stated for
me inexactly by others. As confessions seem now to be the literary
fashion, it has seemed best to put what I have to say in that form.
The method of personal statement enables me also to bring out more
distinctly not merely the views held by many, but also the reasons by
which their course has been influenced. This consequently may serve as
an excuse for a mode of utterance which in the case of one so obscure
as myself would be otherwise out of place. Still, while the sentiments
indicated may be entertained by numbers, they are here to be considered
as nothing more than my own individual opinions. I do not pretend to
speak with authority for any person but myself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span> least of all for any
organization which has started out to carry on the work of spelling
reform. Some, indeed, of the particular views I express may possibly,
or, it may be, will probably, meet with the dissent of those who hold
in general the same beliefs.</p>

<p>Now that the storm and stress which followed the President’s order
is over, now that every one seems to have regained his equanimity, a
fitting moment has apparently arrived to consider the whole subject
itself without reference to the particular proposals of anybody or of
any organization. This can be done at present with a certain detachment
from the feelings which attended the heated controversy that then
prevailed—at least, with as much detachment as is consistent with
the possession of personal convictions. As this treatise, however,
is avowedly egotistical, I may be permitted, before entering into
the general discussion, to refer to a specific charge which has been
regularly brought against me as well as against others. It is all the
more desirable to do so because the consideration of it leads directly
to the comprehension of what is really the great mainstay of the
existing orthography. The charge is that in what I publish I do not use
myself the new spellings, save, at least, on the most limited scale. I
am inconsistent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span> My practice does not conform to my pretended belief.</p>

<p>Now it is very easy to retort the charge of inconsistency. No one
can use our present spelling without being inconsistent; for English
orthography is nothing but a mass of inconsistencies. Take one of
the commonest of illustrations furnished by those opposed to any
reform. You must not drop the <i>u</i> from <i>honour</i>, they tell
us, because that unnecessary vowel shows that the word was derived
immediately from the French, and only remotely from the Latin. On the
contrary, you must retain the <i>b</i> of <i>debt</i> and <i>doubt</i>,
though this letter hides their derivation from the French <i>dette</i>
and <i>doute</i>, and gives the erroneous impression that they were
taken directly from the Latin. Still, it is no real justification for
one’s own conduct to prove that similar conduct is pursued by those who
criticise him for it. Let me bring forward a few reasons which have
influenced my own action, as doubtless they have more or less that of
others.</p>

<p>There is, first, the printing-office to be consulted. This has
generally an orthography of its own, and does not like to have it
deviated from. There is next the publisher to be considered. Even if
he is personally indifferent on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span> the subject of spelling, he has a
pecuniary interest in the work he is bringing out. Naturally he is
reluctant to have introduced into it anything which will tend to retard
its success with the public. As he usually has the means of enforcing
his views, he is very much inclined to employ them.</p>

<p>But far more important, far more restraining than the attitude either
of printer or publisher is that of the public itself. It is not simply
indifferent: it is largely hostile. To many men a strange spelling
is offensive; by the ill-informed it is regarded as portending ruin
to the language. Necessarily no writer desires to limit his possible
audience by running counter to its feelings in a matter which has no
direct bearing upon the subject of which he treats. In my own case the
public—most unwisely, as it naturally strikes me—is none too anxious
under any circumstances to read what I write. Why, therefore, should I
convert what is in my eyes a culpable lack of interest into absolute
indifference or active hostility by rousing the prejudices of readers
in consequence of insisting upon a point which has only a remote
concern with the actual topic that may be under consideration?</p>

<p>These are reasons which I could fairly and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span> honestly give. But,
after all, the main one is something entirely different, something
altogether independent of the feelings of others. With advancing years
knowledge may or may not come; but altruism distinctly lingers. As we
get along in life most of us lose the inclination to be constantly
engaged in fighting strenuously for the progress of even the most
praiseworthy causes. The desire wanes of benefiting your fellow-man,
while encountering in so doing not merely his indifference, but his
active hostility; of urging him to show himself rational while his
proclivities are violently asinine. Even the far keener enjoyment
of rendering him miserable by making evident to his reluctant but
slowly dawning intelligence how much of an ignoramus, not to say
idiot, he has shown himself in his acts and utterances—even this
most poignant of pleasures loses its relish if indulgence in it
can be secured only at the cost of much personal trouble. This is
just as true of spelling reform as of any other movement. In fact,
indifference to the propagation of the truth about it may be regarded
as a species of that very altruism of which I have just disclaimed
the practice. If a man seriously believes that it is essential to
the purity and perfection of the English language that <i>honor</i>
should be spelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span> with a <i>u</i> and <i>horror</i> without it; that
<i>honorable</i> should be spelled with a <i>u</i> and <i>honorary</i>
without it; that <i>meter</i> should have its final syllable in
<i>re</i> and <i>diameter</i> and <i>hexameter</i> in <i>er</i>; that
<i>deign</i> should terminate in <i>eign</i> and its allied compound
form <i>disdain</i> in <i>ain</i>; that <i>convey</i> should end in
<i>ey</i> and <i>inveigh</i> in <i>eigh</i>; that <i>precede</i> should
end in <i>ede</i> and <i>proceed</i> in <i>eed</i>; that <i>fancy</i>
should begin with <i>f</i> and <i>phantom</i> with <i>ph</i>; that
<i>deceit</i> should be written without <i>p</i> and <i>receipt</i>
with it; if, in fine, spelling in different ways words which have the
same origin brings him pleasure, why not leave him in the undisturbed
enjoyment of this mild form of imbecility? He will not be made happier
by being made wiser.</p>

<p>It is natural, therefore, that the position of the man who has got
along in years should tend to be rather that of a looker-on than of a
participant in the strife. He feels more and more disposed to content
himself with approving and applauding the work of the younger and
better soldiers. My own attitude is, indeed, very much the same as
that once described to me as his by my dear and honored friend, the
late Professor Child of Harvard. He sometimes did and sometimes did
not employ in his correspondence the reformed spellings which were
recommended by the English and American philological societies.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span> It
may be added, in passing, that these changes, with the weight of the
greatest scholars of both countries behind them, were in general
treated with almost absolute indifference; or, if considered at all,
met usually with the same unintelligent opposition as have the lists
put forth by the Simplified Spelling Board. “If I am writing,” said
Professor Child, “to one of these educated ignoramuses who think there
is something sacred about the present orthography, I always take care
to use the altered forms; but when writing to a man who really knows
something about the subject, I am apt not to take the extra trouble
required to conform to the recommendations made by the two philological
societies.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In not following my faith by my practice, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span> am perfectly willing to
concede that my course is not merely inconsistent, but unmanly. I
shall not quarrel with any one who calls it pusillanimous, and even
mean. Intimations to that effect have been made to me more than once
in private letters. These reproaches I recognize as deserved, and I
therefore receive them with meekness. But one of the reasons given
above for my action, or rather inaction—the hostility of readers to
new spellings—points directly to the one mighty obstacle which stands
in the way of reforming our orthography. It is, in truth, all-potent.
Singularly enough, however, it is so far from receiving consideration
that it hardly ever receives much more than mere mention.</p>

<p>The regard for our present orthography is not based at all upon
knowledge, or upon reason. It owes its existence and its strength
almost entirely to sentiment. We give it other names, indeed. We
describe the motives which animate us in big phrases. We talk of our
devotion to the language of our fathers, while displaying the amplest
possible ignorance of what that language was. We please ourselves with
the notion that in denouncing any change we are nobly maintaining
the historic continuity of the speech. As a matter of fact, we are
governed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span> by the cheap but all-powerful sentiment of association. We
like the present orthography because we are used to it. When once the
point of intimate familiarity with the form of a word has been reached,
it makes thenceforward no difference to us how wide is the divergence
between the pronunciation and the spelling which is ostensibly designed
to represent the pronunciation. As little difference does it make
if the form with which we have become familiar not merely fails to
indicate the origin of the word, but on the contrary suggests and
even imposes upon the mind a belief in an utterly false derivation.
Such considerations do not affect us in the slightest. We simply like
the spelling to which we are accustomed; we dislike the spelling to
which we are not accustomed. No one who familiarizes himself with the
articles in newspapers and magazines written by the defenders of the
present orthography can entertain the slightest doubt on this point.
The arguments advanced amount to nothing more than this, that any new
spelling employed is distasteful to the writer because it breaks up old
associations.</p>

<p>Because hostility to change springs not from knowledge, not from
reason, but almost entirely from sentiment, it must not be inferred
that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span> obstacle it presents to reform is a slight one. On the
contrary, it is peculiarly formidable. So far from being a feeble
barrier to overcome, it is of the very strongest, if not the very
strongest. The fact that in numerous instances it is based upon
foundations demonstrably irrational does not in the least impair its
influence. In any matter of controversy we can fight with assurance
of success against beliefs which the holder has honestly, even if
mistakenly, adopted, because he deems them to be in accordance with
reason. Appeal can then be made to his intelligence. But not so in the
case of a belief based primarily upon sentiment. This is constantly
exemplified in controversies about politics or religion. But nowhere is
the fact more conspicuous than in the matter of English orthography.
To spell differently from what we have been trained to spell irritates
many of us almost beyond the point of endurance. We can manage to put
up with variations from the present orthography prevailing in past
centuries when we come to learn enough about the subject to be aware
that such variations existed. The writers of those times had not
reached that exalted plane of perfect propriety on which it is our good
fortune to live and move. But no contemporary must venture to free
himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span> from the cast-iron shackles in which we have inclosed the form
of our words without subjecting his action to our indignant protest.</p>

<p>It is vain to deny the strength of the feeling of association. Even
to those who have ascended out of the atmosphere of serene ignorance
in which it flourishes most luxuriantly, a new spelling is always apt
to come with something of a sense of shock. No matter how fully we
recognize the impropriety and even absurdity of the old form, none
the less does the sentiment of association cling to it and affect our
attitude toward it. As this treatise sets out to deal somewhat with
my own impressions, I may be pardoned the employment of a personal
exemplification of the point under discussion. German is, for practical
purposes, mainly a phonetic tongue. In modern times anomalies which
once existed have been largely swept away. It is merely a question
of a few years when they will all go; for, Germany being a nation of
scholars, scholars have there some influence. In studying the language
as a boy I learned some spellings now rarely used. For instance,
<i>thun</i> and <i>todt</i> appeared then in the forms here given. Now
I see the one without the <i>h</i>, the other without the <i>d</i>.
I recognize the propriety of the action taken in dropping the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
unpronounced letters. But, while my judgment is perfectly convinced of
its correctness, for the life of me I cannot get over a certain sense
of strangeness when I come across the words in their new form—at
least, it was some time before I could.</p>

<p>How much, indeed, we are all affected by this influence of association
one illustration will make convincingly clear. In the sixteenth century
there existed an occasional tendency to spell <i>hot</i> with an
initial <i>w</i>. It was an effort to represent the pronunciation of
the word which had begun to prevail in certain quarters. It did not
drive out the present form, but it existed alongside of it. It was a
spelling to which Spenser was particularly addicted. There are many
instances of the use of it in the <i>Faerie Queene</i>, of which the
following may serve as examples:</p>

<p class="poetry">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To pluck it out with pincers firie whot.</span><br>
</p>

<p class="poetry">
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">—<i>Book I, canto x, st. 26.</i></span><br>
</p>

<p class="poetry">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He soone approached, panting, breathlesse, whot.</span><br>
</p>

<p class="poetry">
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">—<i>Book II, canto iv, st. 37.</i></span><br>
</p>

<p class="poetry">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon a mightie furnace, burning whote.</span><br>
</p>

<p class="poetry">
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">—<i>Ib., canto ix, st. 29.</i></span><br>
</p>

<p>Now, at the present day, anybody would be either amused at the
appearance of such a form as <i>whot</i> if one so spelled the word
ignorantly, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span> outraged if he did it purposely. But all of us in the
case of <i>whole</i> are doing precisely the very thing we should
condemn in the case of <i>whot</i>. In the former of these words
the initial letter has now no more excuse for its existence than in
the latter. <i>Whole</i>, by derivation, is precisely the same word
as <i>hale</i>. The only real difference between these forms is the
difference of vowel sound caused by dialectical variation. They are
both related to <i>heal</i> and <i>health</i>. The closeness of the tie
between them all is brought out distinctly in the phrase “whole and
sound.” For centuries, too, the word had the spelling <i>hole</i>. At a
later period, like <i>hot</i>, it took unto itself an initial <i>w</i>;
unlike <i>hot</i>, it continued to retain it. Consequently, we find
exemplified in the two words the same old influence of which we have
been speaking. The very persons who would be horrified, and properly
horrified, at giving to <i>hot</i> the spelling <i>whot</i>, would be
equally horrified at taking away from <i>whole</i> a letter which,
besides being never heard in pronunciation, disguises the derivation;
and the recognition of this latter at a glance is insisted upon by many
as essential to the proper representation of the word as well as to
their own personal happiness. Here, as elsewhere, it is sentiment that
rules us, not sense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>It is unquestionably a distinct objection to the introduction of new
spellings that they have the temporary effect of breaking up old
associations. They consequently distract the attention of the reader
from the idea the word conveys to the word itself. This would to some
extent be true, even were he strongly in favor of the changes made.
Necessarily this is much more the case when he is bitterly opposed
to them, and honestly, no matter how unintelligently, fancies that
the fate of the language is bound up with the continuance of some
particular method of spelling. It is true that the frequent occurrence
of a new form on the printed page soon dispels the sense of strangeness
with which it is greeted at first. But to produce that effort speedily,
the reader must have an open mind. An open mind, however, is just
what the ordinary believer in the present orthography lacks. He not
only conceives an intense prejudice against the new form itself, but
he is sometimes unwilling to read the book or article containing it.
This, I have already intimated, is my main reason for not adopting in
practice several spellings which in theory I approve. Some of the old
ones to which many are devoted are too much for even the large charity
I entertain for the most undesirable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span> citizens of the orthographic
commonwealth. But with others I put up because it is only by using them
that one can succeed in getting a hearing from those who most need
to be made conscious of the extent of their linguistic ignorance and
the depth of their orthographic depravity. It is the unbelievers that
require conversion, and not those who are already firm in the faith.
Accordingly, for the sake of a temporary communication between the
multitude which still continues to sit in linguistic darkness and him
who seeks to enlighten them, the old spelling may be properly used as a
sort of material bridge over which to trundle orthographic truth.</p>

<p>Necessarily, violent hostility to new spellings has always to be
reckoned with. It is by no means so intense or so wide-spread as
it was once. The language employed is now much more guarded. Men
have come to gain some comprehension of the boundlessness of their
ignorance of the subject, and have learned in consequence the wisdom
of putting restraint upon expression. Intemperate invectives will,
indeed, continue to be heard for a long while yet. Rarely, however,
will they proceed from any quarter where we have a right to expect
real intelligence. Doubtless belated survivals of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span> previous era
of good old-fashioned gentlemanly ignorance will occasionally thrust
themselves upon the attention; but these ebullitions now surprise and
amuse rather than irritate. A case in point comes to my mind. In the
latter part of 1906 I chanced to be in London during the period when
a violent controversy was going on between the <i>Times</i> and the
publishers as to the prices at which books were to be offered for
sale. Every morning the columns of the great daily were filled with
letters on one side or the other of the matter at issue. Naturally
the participators in this bibliopolic tournament did not invariably
confine themselves to the special subject under discussion. Toward
the very close of the year a particularly precious effusion on a side
issue came from one of the correspondents.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> His patriotic soul had
been stirred to the depths by the fact, as he asserted, that English
publishers had been guilty of using what he called American spelling
in their books. They had indulged in this heinous crime from the
ignoble lust of gain. He had declined, in consequence, to buy works he
needed and desired because they were printed in this fashion. “It is a
treason against our language and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span> country,” he wrote, “and not merely
an offence against taste.” Further, the writer of this extraordinary
communication incidentally took pains to inform us that he had been the
winner of a prize essay at Cambridge University. Presumably, therefore,
he had reached an appreciable degree of mental development and was in
possession of some intelligence, however little his utterances might
seem to indicate it.</p>

<p>English scholarship has been too commonly distinct from scholarship
in English; but in these latter days it creates some little surprise
to find displayed publicly by a presumably educated man so gross a
manifestation of all-pervading ignorance as is exemplified in the
communication just mentioned. Undoubtedly there are still many who
think just such thoughts, if it be proper to dignify sentiments of
this sort with the name of thoughts. But it is really too late to give
them public utterance—at least, with the writer’s name attached. That
should be safely sheltered behind the bulwark of type. Better still,
such opinions should be reserved for the circle of one’s private
friends, either ignorant enough to sympathize with them, or too much
attached to the speaker to expose them to the comment of a more
intelligent, but also more unfeeling, world. Things, indeed, cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
be said now that could be said with impunity, and to some extent with
applause, fifty years ago—and even twenty-five years ago could be said
with safety. During the last half century men have been running to and
fro, and knowledge has been increased. This is true in particular of
the knowledge of English orthography, of its history and its character.
So generally, indeed, have special students, and even occasionally
highly educated men, become familiar with the fact of the differences
between the spelling of the present and that of the past, and to a less
extent, with the changes that have taken place at various periods and
with the causes that have brought them about, that it startles one at
first to discover that there are quarters into which not even a ray of
this light has penetrated.</p>

<p>It is, however, no difficult matter to point out the grand source of
erroneous beliefs of this sort. It all goes back to the sentiment of
association. Unhappily this sentiment of association never receives
check or correction, because we familiarize ourselves with the
language of the past in the spelling of the present. In the matter of
orthography, the dead author is considered to have no rights which
the living publisher is bound to respect. His spelling is regularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
altered so as to conform to that of the particular dictionary which has
been adopted in the printing-house as a sort of official guide. This is
done even when the writer himself has felt and expressed solicitude as
to the form in which his words should appear. There was a period when
a somewhat similar treatment was meted out to his grammar. The great
works of the past underwent at one time more or less revision at the
hands of the veriest literary hacks, who made changes in the language
in order to reconcile it to their notions of propriety of usage. Idioms
had their structure sometimes modified, sometimes improved out of
existence. Sentences were recast in order to correct supposed errors,
and bring them into accord with the rules laid down in the latest
school grammar. This was particularly true of the latter half of the
eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth. Hence, editions
of the classic authors of our tongue then appearing can frequently
not be consulted with confidence by him to whom it is of importance
to ascertain, in any given case, the words, forms, and constructions
actually used by the writer.</p>

<p>This condition of things is no longer true of the grammar and
expression. Modern editors, as a general rule, pay scrupulous heed to
the exact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span> reproduction of the words and constructions of the original,
whether these accord or not with their ideas of propriety. But as yet
there is little of this sensitiveness of feeling about the orthography.
It may be conceded that the matter is not in itself so important for
a certain class of readers. The expression, after all, is the vital
concern. Accordingly, in a work designed for the use of the great
body of men, it may not be desirable to reproduce peculiarities of
orthography so numerous and so variant from present use as to interfere
with ease of reading, or distract attention from the thought to the
form of the words in which the thought is clothed. While, therefore,
the reproduction of the exact spelling of a classic work is essential
to the educated man who desires to be acquainted with the history of
the speech, it is of but subsidiary importance to perhaps a majority of
ordinary readers. Even an author so late as Shakespeare would hardly
have been the popular writer he is had the mass of men been compelled
to read him in the spelling in which his works originally appeared.
Something has undoubtedly been lost by conforming his orthography to
that of the present time, but doubtless much more has been gained in
the wider reading his works have received in consequence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>Considerations of this sort do not apply to works designed strictly for
the specialist and the highly educated. But even in the case of the
great mass of men they do not apply to works which have been published
since English orthography fell under the sway of the printing-house.
The variations from the existing forms are indeed increasingly numerous
the farther we go back; but even where they most prevail they are not
really large in number or serious in character. Certainly they would
not present to an intelligent human being the slightest obstacle
to ease of reading or of comprehension. Hence, we have a right to
demand that the few variations which exist should be reproduced both
in their integrity and their entirety; that an edition of an author
belonging to these later periods should represent his spelling as well
as his grammar. In the vast majority of instances—excluding avowed
reprints—this is not now the case. In the matter of orthography,
rarely do editors or publishers have any conscience. The works of
the past, even of the immediate past, are presented to us not in the
spelling of the past, but in that of the present.</p>

<p>Hence, there is no occasion for surprise that such pitiful exhibitions
of ignorance are so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span> constantly displayed by men from whom we should
naturally expect better things. The large majority of even cultivated
readers do not see the words used by any great author of the past
in the way in which he himself spelled them. They see them only as
the modern printer chooses to spell them for him. It is, therefore,
not surprising that the existing orthography should come to seem to
such men not the comparatively late creation it is, but as something
which has about it all the flavor of antiquity. As an inevitable
result, there has been further imparted to it the odor of sanctity.
Ignorance is recognized everywhere as a mother of devotion. Nowhere
has there been a more striking manifestation of this truth than in
the case of our spelling. The adoring worship of it seems to be more
widely diffused in England than in America—at least, it is there more
shameless in the exhibition of its lack of knowledge, though that is
saying a good deal. We have all of late been made familiar with the
somewhat unfortunate remark of an English writer, that the spelling
of Shakespeare was good enough for him. Now an assertion of this sort
would be worthless as an argument, even were it based upon a foundation
of ascertained fact. We do not deprive ourselves of existing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
facilities of any sort, because they were not only unused, but were
unheard of in the time of Queen Elizabeth. No one now feels himself
under the necessity of refraining from making a rapid trip to Stratford
by rail because Shakespeare was compelled to journey thither slowly and
laboriously over the wretchedest of roads.</p>

<p>But in this instance an argument, worthless in itself, is made
even more worthless, if possible, because the facts upon which it
is presumed to be founded do not exist. Shakespeare flourished in
a period when no eager desire existed for the maintenance of any
strict orthographic monopoly. Within certain well-defined limits
every one spelled pretty much as he pleased. Hence, the same word
cannot infrequently be found in his writings, and in those of
his contemporaries, with marked diversities of form. His usage,
furthermore, differed in some cases entirely from any known to the
modern world. But if his printed works fairly represent his practice,
he evinced in many instances a perverse preference for what the
semi-educated call American spelling. Let us test the truth of this
last assertion by examining the attitude he assumed in a matter about
which an orthographic controversy has been raging for centuries.
This is the case of certain words which, according to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span> one method of
spelling, end in <i>er</i>, according to the other, in <i>re</i>.</p>

<p>As regards orthography, these words naturally divide themselves into
two classes. In the first of these the termination is preceded by
<i>c</i>. When this is the case the words fall under the influence
of a general principle regulating pronunciation—so far as general
principles can be said to regulate anything in English. According
to it, <i>c</i> before the vowel <i>e</i> assumes the sound of
<i>s</i>. The words of this particular class which Shakespeare uses
are <i>acre</i>, <i>lucre</i>, and <i>massacre</i>. Were they made to
end in <i>er</i>, they would have to come into conflict with the rule
just mentioned. As a result they would mislead, as to their proper
pronunciation, those who saw them for the first time. Under present
conditions, they therefore cannot well undergo any change. The only way
out of the difficulty would be to substitute <i>k</i> for <i>c</i>.
Such a course we have taken, for instance, in the case of the word
<i>joke</i>. This comes from the Latin <i>joc-us</i> with the same
meaning. At its first introduction into the speech, in the latter part
of the seventeenth century, it was spelled <i>joque</i> or <i>joc</i>.
It finally gave up the <i>c</i> of the original and substituted for it
<i>k</i>. On the other hand, in the adjective <i>jocose</i>, we retain
the letter of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span> the primitive which we have discarded in the noun.</p>

<p>This state of things is modern, because in Anglo-Saxon <i>c</i>
had always the sound of <i>k</i>. Consequently, in <i>æcer</i>,
the original of our word <i>acre</i>, there was neither difficulty
nor confusion created by the employment of the letter. All this,
however, was changed by the Norman Conquest. The pronunciation of
<i>c</i> was in consequence affected, as it still is, by a following
<i>e</i>. The result was that for a long time <i>k</i> was largely
substituted in this particular word for the original letter. But in
the fourteenth century the present method of spelling it came into
fashion. It has remained in fashion ever since. The earlier form
maintained itself for a while as of equal authority. It, indeed, died
out slowly and reluctantly; but it died at last. In the collected
edition of Shakespeare’s plays, which appeared in 1623, <i>acre</i>
was practically the only recognized spelling. The word occurs in this
work just seven times. In one instance only does the older form crop
up. When Hamlet tells Laertes, “Let them throw millions of acres on
us,” the word is spelled <i>akers</i>.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In a similar way Bacon in his
<i>Advancement of Learning</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span> uses <i>lukar</i> for <i>lucre</i>. But
examples of practices such as these are exceptional.</p>

<p>Consideration of a like sort does not, however, apply to the words
of the second class to be considered. There are several of these now
found with the ending <i>er</i> or <i>re</i> which do not appear
in Shakespeare’s writings. Conspicuous among those not used by him
are <i>fibre</i> or <i>fiber</i>, <i>miter</i> or <i>mitre</i>,
<i>niter</i> or <i>nitre</i>, <i>sabre</i> or <i>saber</i>,
<i>specter</i> or <i>spectre</i>. But the words of this second class
which actually occur are more numerous than those of the first class.
The most common ones employed by him, about which variation of usage
now prevails, are <i>center</i> or <i>centre</i>, <i>luster</i>
or <i>lustre</i>, <i>meager</i> or <i>meagre</i>, <i>meter</i> or
<i>metre</i>, <i>scepter</i> or <i>sceptre</i>, <i>sepulcher</i> or
<i>sepulchre</i>, <i>theater</i> or <i>theatre</i>. It becomes a
matter, therefore, of some interest to discover which of these forms
must be chosen by the writer who professes that Shakespeare’s spelling
is good enough for him. The evidence afforded by the printed page—in
this case the only evidence that can be secured—is accordingly given
in the following paragraph.</p>

<p>Take the spelling of the words just mentioned as it is found in the
folio of 1623. <i>Center</i> appears precisely twelve times in that
volume. It is never spelled with <i>re</i>. In ten instances it has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
the termination <i>er</i>. Once the form <i>centry</i> is found,
and once <i>centure</i>. <i>Meager</i> occurs five times. In every
instance it ends in <i>er</i>. This similar statement may be made of
<i>meter</i>, which is used but twice. In both these cases it has
the termination <i>er</i>. <i>Scepter</i> is a word found far more
frequently. It appears just thirty-five times.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Not once does it
have the ending <i>re</i>; it is invariably <i>er</i>. The case is not
essentially different with <i>sepulcher</i>. Thirteen times it occurs;
eleven times with the termination <i>er</i>, twice with the termination
<i>re</i>.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> About the theater Shakespeare may be supposed to have had
some knowledge. The word itself appears but six times in his plays. But
even in these few instances he seems to have felt a perverse preference
for the spelling in <i>er</i> over that in <i>re</i>. The former occurs
just five times, the latter but once. The only consolation left for him
who combines devotion to Shakespeare with devotion to the ending in
<i>re</i> is found in the word spelled <i>lustre</i> or <i>luster</i>.
It appears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span> exactly thirteen times. Seven times it is spelled the
former way, six times the latter.</p>

<p>Spellings of this sort, it may be added, are far from being limited
to Shakespeare’s age. They were followed by many writers much later.
Modern editions, to which we are accustomed, do more, as already
intimated, than hide the fact from our eyes. They actually prevent, for
most of us, the possibility of discovering it. Hence, the prevalent
lack of intelligence, with its consequent hardiness of assertion, not
unfrequently accompanied with the feeling of distress and repulsion
at any proposal for change. He whose heart is affected with sadness
at the sight of the spelling <i>theater</i> for <i>theatre</i> or
<i>center</i> for <i>centre</i>, and whose prophetic soul foresees
disaster as the result of the general adoption of such forms, would
find his grief alleviated and his fears dispelled if he could only
extend his knowledge sufficiently to familiarize himself with the real
practice of the past, instead of getting his notions about it from the
falsifications of the present. Examine, for instance, in regard to the
very usage under discussion, the first edition of Addison’s <i>Remarks
on Italy</i>. This work was brought out in 1705 by Tonson, the most
noted publisher of the time. The same variation which prevailed earlier
in the use of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span> terminations still continued. But there continued
also a distinct preference for <i>er</i> over <i>re</i>. <i>Fiber</i>,
<i>salt-peter</i>, and <i>scepter</i> are found as here printed.
<i>Theater</i> occurs seven times, six times as <i>theater</i>, and
once—in poetry—as <i>theatre</i>. <i>Amphitheater</i> is used ten
times in all. Once its plural is spelled <i>amphitheatres</i>; in the
other nine instances it has the ending in <i>er</i>.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> On the other
hand, <i>meager</i> and <i>niter</i>, both of which are used once,
and <i>sepulcher</i>, which appears five times, have the termination
<i>re</i>. Or, take <i>Gulliver’s Travels</i>, which came out more than
a score of years later. The first edition of the work was published in
1726 in two volumes. In it <i>center</i> is found just seven times.
In every instance it is spelled with the ending <i>er</i>, not once
in <i>re</i>. <i>Meager</i>, it may be added, occurs twice, and in
both cases as here spelled.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> But here again, as in most other works,
modern reprints falsify the record.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>In these instances it is easy enough to exaggerate the importance of
the evidence furnished on this point; at least, it is so in the case
of the Elizabethans. In any fair discussion of orthography, two things
are to be kept in view. One is to ascertain the exact facts; the other
is not to get from them erroneous impressions. Let us go back, for
instance, to Shakespeare and his spelling of words with the endings
<i>er</i> or <i>re</i>. It is not in the least desirable to attribute
to him feelings which he never had, nor even dreamed of having. Like
his contemporaries, he found two forms of these words in use. Like
them, he attached no particular sanctity to either. He unquestionably
felt himself at liberty to use both. All, therefore, that one can
positively say in the case of these words is that if Shakespeare had
any preference, it was manifestly in favor of the termination in
<i>er</i>.</p>

<p>If it be urged that the plays published after his death do not
represent either his opinion or his practice, it is fair to say in
reply that a like condition of things is revealed in the minor poems.
All of these appeared in his lifetime. Over the printing of some of
them he may have had no oversight. For the spelling of the words found
in these he cannot, therefore, be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span> held directly responsible. Still,
the two most important of them—<i>Venus and Adonis</i> and <i>The Rape
of Lucrece</i>—must, in going through the press, have passed under his
own eye. In consequence, the spelling employed could not have failed to
receive his tacit sanction at least, if even, what is more probable,
he was not himself primarily responsible for it. Yet in these very two
poems <i>scepter</i><a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and <i>sepulcher</i><a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> are found so spelled in
the original editions. A like statement may be made of this last word
in the single instance in which it occurs in the <i>Sonnets</i>.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
Further, the same thing may be said about his use of <i>center</i><a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
and <i>meter</i>.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Each appears but once, but it appears as just
given. On the other hand <i>meager</i>, which is found five times in
this form in the plays, has the spelling <i>meagre</i><a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> in its
solitary occurrence in the poems. For neither one of these forms is
Shakespeare likely to have felt any decided preference. Still, he could
not have failed to see that there was no more reason for the spelling
<i>meagre</i> instead of <i>meager</i> than there was for <i>eagre</i>
in place of <i>eager</i>, or, to adopt the more common earlier
orthography, <i>egre</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>Besides these words there were two others of the class considered,
about which variation of usage existed or exists. Because of their
single occurrence in his writing, their spelling can be regarded of
importance only as indicating tendency. Othello, in his account of his
life, speaks of “antres vast and deserts idle,” as it is found in all
modern editions. But Shakespeare has no such form as <i>antres</i>.
In the first folio it is <i>antars</i>; in the quarto of 1622 it is
<i>antrees</i>, indicating a difference of pronunciation. The word
itself is rare at any period. Its later use, so far as it has been
used at all, is due to its appearance in a favorite play of the
great dramatist. No one among his contemporaries seems, so far as is
now known, to have felt it desirable or incumbent to resort to its
employment; though later investigations may cause it to turn up at
any time. But the form in which we know it is not due to Shakespeare
himself, but to his editors. There seems little reason for denying
him the privilege of spelling the word in his own way. There is
still another term, now not uncommon, which is found but once in his
writings. But the villainous stuff which Henry IV.’s ambassador told
Hotspur was digged from the bowels of the earth to destroy brave
men, was not <i>salt-petre</i>, as modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span> editions have it, but
<i>salt-peter</i> in the original.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>These are all the disputed words of this class which are found in the
poems of Shakespeare as well as in his plays, as also the number of
times of their occurrence. Facts of this sort are familiar, at least
in a general way, to all special students of our speech. But even from
the highly educated they are hidden more or less, and in many cases
hidden altogether. These see ordinarily nothing but modern editions
of the greatest writers; and in modern editions modern orthography is
substituted for the orthography which the authors of the past favored,
or at least endured. The result is that the feeling of association
which attaches to every word a particular form is never subjected to
the counteracting influence which would spring from coming even into
occasional contact with the earlier usage. The strength of this feeling
has in consequence become abnormal. From it has further developed the
singular belief of the orthographically uneducated that the present
spelling is somehow bound up with the purity of the language, if not
with its continued existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>It is because I look upon this sentiment of association as the main
bulwark of our present orthography that I have always taken the ground
that it is only through a rising generation that any thorough-going
reform can ever be accomplished. It is asking too much of human nature
to expect a generation already risen to go a second time through
the fiery ordeal of learning to spell. Individuals belonging to it
will adopt proposed changes, especially those in whom conviction is
reinforced by the energy of youth or of personal character. Of these
there will be a regularly increasing number with the enlightenment
which is sure to follow discussion of the subject. But the action of
the great mass of even highly educated men will not be affected. This
state of things would probably be true of the spelling of any language;
but in one so defiant of all law as our own, the aversion to change
would increase in proportion to the lawlessness. We are not disposed
to give up what with so much toil we have acquired. Furthermore,
there comes to be in the minds of many a certain fondness for the
existing orthography because of its very irrationality, of its constant
unfitness to fulfil its professed aim of representing pronunciation.
Its uncouthness inspires them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span> with the same sort of devotion with
which the lower order of savage tribes regard their gods. The uglier
they are, the more fervently they are adored.</p>

<p>In the case of a rising generation there are no such feelings to be
encountered. The soil is virgin. No prejudices are to be overcome,
no sentiments to be shocked, no customs to be changed. The reasoning
powers have not been so blunted by association that the mind looks with
favor upon what is defiant of reason. Furthermore, about the changed
and correct forms would speedily gather the same sentiment which has
caused the previous forms to be cherished by their elders. The younger
generation will in time do more than look upon the new spellings as the
only conceivably rational ones. They will wonder by what perversity
their fathers came to tolerate the old ones in defiance of reason. If
a child has been accustomed from his earliest years to use exclusively
the forms <i>vext</i> and <i>mixt</i>, the spellings <i>vexed</i> and
<i>mixed</i> will not only seem offensive to him when he becomes a man,
but it will be difficult for him to comprehend the precise nature of
the irrationality which could ever have insisted upon it as a virtue
that the combination <i>ed</i> should have the sound of <i>t</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>A risen generation, accordingly, cannot reasonably be expected to
adopt a new spelling. The most that can be asked of it is that it
shall not put itself in active opposition, that it shall let the task
of improving our present barbarous orthography go on unimpeded. This,
however, is the very last thing it is inclined to do. The fathers have
eaten sour grapes; they have no intention of keeping their children’s
children’s teeth from being set on edge. Yet there is plainly to be
recognized now the existence of a steadily increasing number of persons
who are disposed to consider this whole question carefully. In the case
of such men—upon whose co-operation the success of any movement must
ultimately depend—it is all-essential that the changes proposed should
recommend themselves by their manifest propriety or by the probability
of their general acceptance. They may be unwilling to take the trouble
to use these new forms in their own practice, even if convinced of
their desirableness; but they will be ready to cast their influence in
favor of their adoption by the members of that rising generation to
whom the spelling of certain words in certain ways has not yet become
almost a second nature.</p>

<p>The permanent success of any spelling reform, according to this view,
depends upon its adoption<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span> by a rising generation. To have it so
adopted, it must recommend itself to the risen generation as being
both desirable and feasible. Unreasoning ignorance, intrenched behind
a rampart of prejudice, can be ignored. Not so the honest ignorance
of those whose training naturally inclines them to favor what has
been long received, but who are not averse to consider the question
in dispute fully and fairly. In any case the changes proposed, in
order to succeed, must follow the line of least resistance; for they
have to encounter that peculiarly formidable of hostile forces—the
unintelligent opposition of the intelligent. The altered forms
recommended for adoption must, therefore, have at the outset some
support either in present or past usage, or they must be in accord with
the operation of some law modifying orthography, which has always been
steadily, even if imperceptibly, at work in the language.</p>

<p>It is because it does not conform to either of these principles that,
had I had anything to say about it, I should have objected to the
recommendation of the spelling <i>thru</i>. My reasons for taking
such ground would have had nothing to do with the abstract propriety
or impropriety of the new form. Nor could exception be taken to it on
the score of derivation. The original<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span> word, indeed, from which it
came was <i>thurh</i>. Later this appeared at times as <i>thruh</i>.
No fault could, therefore, be found with the alteration beyond the
dropping of the sign of the no longer pronounced guttural. It is not
principle, therefore, that would have come into the consideration
of it, but expediency. I should have objected to it solely on the
ground that it is a violent break with the literary past. Therefore,
instead of following the line of least resistance, it would follow the
line of greatest. It would be sure, in consequence, to excite bitter
hostility and to repel support from the other recommendations made.
Its adoption into the list would, therefore, not have seemed to me
good policy. This is a view of the matter entirely independent of my
personal indisposition to favor vowel changes in the spelling until a
settled plan for the representation of the vowel sounds has been agreed
upon and accepted. Yet it is fair to add that in consequence of the
frequency with which the new form has been made the subject of attack,
the sense of strangeness and the resultant hostility with which it was
first greeted have now largely worn away.</p>

<p>It has been asserted that hostility to the very idea of reforming
the spelling has largely its source in the erroneous beliefs, with
the prejudices<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span> engendered of them, that have come to prevail in
consequence of tampering with the orthography found in the works of
the past, and reproducing them in the orthography of the present. In
time, and with effort, the widely diffused ignorance so generated
can be trusted to disappear. But even when this obstacle is removed,
another of the same general nature still remains. It is, perhaps, full
as formidable. There is no reference here to the difficulty inherent
in the very character of our spelling—a difficulty that is far the
most serious of all. This is, however, a subject which will come up
for consideration by itself. The obstacle here in mind lies in the
very nature of the men of our race. It is an obstruction by no means
confined to them; only in them it is more pronounced than in the case
of other nations with other tongues. The English-speaking people, in
their attempts at carrying out any reform, are little inclined to act
logically. They do not place clearly before themselves the exact nature
of the evil they propose to attack, and then set out to extirpate it
root and branch, according to certain well-defined principles. On the
contrary, they work by the rule of thumb. They find a flaw here, a
defect there. They then proceed to remedy it as best they can without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
disturbing and disarranging the rest of the structure. Accordingly, no
symmetry is displayed in the character of the alteration made and no
perfection in the result.</p>

<p>Still, about this method there are manifest advantages. Whatever
changes are effected are effected with the least possible friction, and
after the least possible struggle. They are brought about so gradually
that the minds of men are comparatively little disturbed by the break
with the past which has been made. There still remain relics of its
absurdities with which they can console themselves for what they have
lost. Consequently, the alterations, however much an object of dislike,
cause nothing of that intense hostility which attends any scientific
and, therefore, sweeping reform.</p>

<p>In this respect our race stands in sharpest contrast with that foreign
one with which its connections have been closest—which has often
been its enemy and occasionally its ally. The French mind, unlike
the English, is by nature severe and logical. It cares little for
precedent. It fixes its eyes upon principle. It is disposed to follow
any reform it accepts to its remotest conclusion. It drops without
hesitation long-cherished excrescences, brings order out of chaos,
even if in so doing it is forced to disregard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span> traditions and override
cherished sentiments. We can see the attitude of the French mind as
contrasted with that of the English best illustrated in comparatively
recent French history. The Revolution was a period of storm and stress.
Things were then attempted which would hardly have been thought of, far
less tried, at any ordinary period. But the point here is that such
things could never have been carried out by the men of the English race
at the most extraordinary period. It is not merely that they would not
have been done; they would not have been contemplated. To unify France,
for illustration, it was essential, in the eyes of the revolutionists,
that the ancient provinces should be obliterated, so far as their
size would permit their entire effacement. They therefore cut up the
land into departments. In these the old boundaries were disregarded.
Sections of different provinces were brought into political union
wherever practicable. New affiliations were to take the place of the
old. The idea of federation was to be destroyed. The provinces were
to be made to disappear as living entities from the minds of men. In
place of them the department, a purely artificial creation, was to be
constantly before their eyes. Men were no longer to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span> Normans or
Bretons or Gascons or Burgundians; they were to be simply Frenchmen.
In diverting the thought of the people from the provinces to the whole
country, the reformers had no hesitation in uprooting the traditions
and common associations which the inhabitants of these provinces had
inherited from the past, and in running counter to sentiments which had
been the outgrowth of centuries.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that in the time of most violent revolution, no idea
of this sort would occur to the men of the English-speaking races. Even
in the case of the counties of Great Britain, where the tie is by no
means strong, it can hardly be conceived as undergoing consideration.
But contemplate the reception that would be given to the project
of breaking up the United States into a series of departments, or
provinces, in which the present boundaries should be obliterated, and
in which all the members should have, as far as possible, the same size
or the same population! Now there would be with us no advantage worth
mentioning in any such action. But suppose there would arise from it
advantages which every one would admit to be of the most immense and
far-reaching importance? Even in that case, imagine the favor any such
proposition would meet with, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span> chances there would be for its
adoption. Yet this is something which revolutionary France not only
set out to accomplish, but actually did accomplish. She accomplished
it, too, not in the case of political entities which, as with us, had
often only a few years of existence, and at best but two or three
hundred, but in the case of provinces whose history went back to the
very beginnings of modern Europe. She overrode all local ties, all
provincial prejudices, in her resolution that her inhabitants should no
longer be citizens of Provence or Normandy or Brittany, but citizens
only of France.</p>

<p>Exactly the same thing may be said of another experiment then made. It
is practically inconceivable to imagine the men of our race, on their
own initiative, devising and setting up such a violent alteration of
all existing practices as was involved in the introduction, in 1799,
of the metrical system of weights and measures. There is no need of
discussing here its abstract superiority or inferiority. The only point
to be made prominent is that the English could not, or at least would
not, have gone at the problem that way. Even if they had solved it to
their satisfaction, they would not have thought of at once proceeding
to put into practice the conclusions reached. The French mind, clear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
and logical, saw, as it believed, the advantage of a uniform system
of weights and measures. One method, for illustration, of weight
for gold and silver, another for drugs and chemicals, another for
ordinary objects, struck them as having no justification in reason.
They took advantage of a period when all ancient beliefs and customs
were on trial for their life to reduce these varying practices to
uniformity. They created a commission of men to study the subject. To
them they intrusted the consideration of it, and instructed them to
report the measures that ought to be taken. Once satisfied that their
recommendations were worthy of adoption, they did not, as would have
been done with us, pigeon-hole the report containing them. Instead,
they enacted them into law and imposed them upon the whole country,
whether men were willing to accept them or averse.</p>

<p>This is the way the French mind works, or, rather, is disposed to work;
for the things accomplished then could not have been accomplished so
suddenly, if even at all, in any ordinary period. But the English
mind does not act in that way. Just as it is in the French blood to
reduce everything to a system of orderly completeness, no matter what
inconveniences may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span> attend the process, so it is in our blood to love
an anomaly for its own sake, frequently to extol it as something
desirable in itself. This difference of mental attitude between the
two races is made strikingly manifest in their treatment of this very
subject of spelling. A difficulty of somewhat the same nature, though
far less in degree, confronts the French as confronts the English.
Their orthography is wretched. It is not by any means so wretched
as ours. Still, it is bad enough to attract the attention of men of
learning and of those engaged in the business of education. The evil
was admitted. What should be the nature of the remedy? To what extent
should, or rather could, reform of the orthography be carried? These
are not revolutionary times, and things which are capable of being
carried through in revolutionary times cannot even be attempted now.
Therefore, one point assumed the place of prominence. This was not
what it was theoretically desirable to do, but what, under modern
conditions, it was practicable to do. Accordingly, as far back as 1903,
the French government appointed a commission to consider the matter.
It embraced some of the most eminent scholars. The committee made a
report, which was submitted by the government to the French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span> Academy.
Disagreement arose, not so much on matters of principle as of detail.
A second commission was appointed to prepare a final plan upon which
the minister of public instruction could take action. Its report has
been published and its conclusions promulgated. They are not binding,
to be sure. Yet, with the weight of the government and the French
Academy behind them, it is merely a question of time when any changes
recommended will be adopted by all.</p>

<p>It is evident from this one fact that the desire to make the spelling
conform as far as possible to the pronunciation—the one object for
which spelling was devised—is far from being confined to the men
of the English-speaking race. Even when it cannot succeed in its
main object, it aims to bring about uniformity by sweeping away the
anomalous. The movement for spelling reform now going on with us is,
therefore, no isolated undertaking. It is simply part of a world-wide
movement in the interests of law and order. There is an intellectual
conscience as well as a moral one. On this subject the intellectual
conscience of the users of speech among all thoroughly enlightened
nations has now been distinctly awakened. The only peculiarity about
English is that the need of such an awakening is far more pressing
than in other tongues, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span> the difficulty of discovering the right
track to follow is far greater. Neither Italian nor Spanish requires
any sweeping change. For all practical purposes, these tongues are
phonetic. Irregularities can unquestionably be found, but they are
neither numerous nor important. Above all, they do not affect the
vital representation of pronunciation by giving, as with us, different
signs to the same sound and different sounds to the same sign. Their
deviation from the phonetic standard is confined to the retention
of unnecessary letters. This is a matter that can be grappled with
easily. On the limited scale it exists, it is not of much moment. Any
variations from the ideal can be easily corrected if the project is
once taken seriously in hand.</p>

<p>In German, the variation from the phonetic standard is greater than in
the two tongues just mentioned. As compared with English, however, it
is exceedingly slight. Even in those instances where it has different
signs to represent the same sound, it does not, as is the case with
our speech, make the confusion more confounded by giving to these same
signs the representation of sounds altogether different. But the public
mind is awake in Germany to the importance of this subject. Many of the
more marked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span> variations from the phonetic ideal have already been done
away with by the action of the several governments. For, in Germany, a
nation of scholars, the control of educational methods is immediately
or remotely in the hands of scholars. These men, not satisfied with
what has already been accomplished, are at work to do away with the
anomalies that continue to exist. When once they come into accord over
the measures to be adopted and the changes to be made, it is merely a
question of time when their proposals will be carried into effect. The
various governments will do the work of promulgation and enforcement.
The reforms recommended will be embodied in the text-books and taught
in the schools. That action once taken, the whole work itself has
practically been done.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, none of the means just mentioned are practicable with
us. The administration of education is nowhere in England or America
really centralized, as it is in France and Germany. In those countries
any changes which have behind them the best expert opinion can be
carried through with comparative ease. The German government will
venture on any educational experiments which have the united support
of German scholars. In France the almost superstitious deference paid
to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span> decisions of the Academy will cause any orthographic changes
having the sanction of that body to be accepted by the great mass of
the community. Individuals may growl, but they will submit. More than
once the Academy has recommended reforms, and these have been adopted
because they were so recommended. About the middle of the eighteenth
century it altered the spelling of five thousand words. Perhaps it
would be juster to say that it indicated, in the case of a number of
these, what one should be adopted of several forms which were then in
use. No one would think now of going back to those against which it
then pronounced. When, therefore, the department of public instruction
and the Academy work together in harmony, their union is irresistible.
Once the reformed spelling is authorized to be taught in the public
schools, the simpler forms can be trusted to work their way by that
inherent strength of their own which comes from inherent sense. Of
course, objection will be made; but it will manifest itself in little
else but empty spluttering or impotent invective on the part of those
who mistake custom and association for reason, and fancy that the life
of a word is found in the form in which they are in the habit of seeing
it clothed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>“They order these matters better in France,” are the words with which
Sterne begins his <i>Sentimental Journey</i>. Any action of the sort
just mentioned is impossible with the men of the English-speaking race.
We have neither the machinery to use, nor the disposition to use it, if
we had it. There is nowhere, either in England or America, any great
centralized authority, literary or administrative, to which deference
if not obedience is felt to be due. With us in the United States
in particular, we have no national government which can authorize
examination of the subject, still less enforce any action. As little
respect is paid to the conclusions of scholars who have made the matter
a special study. With a great body of men the words of the veriest
ignoramus who is able to get access to the columns of a newspaper are
as likely to be heeded as those of him who has spent years in the
investigation of the character and history of English orthography. But
if the ignoramus is merely an ignoramus in this subject, if he chances
to be a man who has shown ability and gained deserved repute in some
other distinct field of endeavor, the authority he has justly secured
for himself in matters he knows a great deal about is transferred to
any pronouncements he chooses to make in a matter he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span> knows little or
nothing about. In considering the construction or reconstruction of
a bridge or building, every one is willing to defer to the judgment
of experts. When, however, it comes to the consideration of spelling,
there is no one who does not have the comfortable consciousness that
on this question his opinion is distinctly more valuable than the
conclusions reached by the wretched cranks who have taken pains to
master the subject, and are necessarily hampered in the views they
entertain by the knowledge they have been unfortunate enough to acquire.</p>

<p>Therefore, as contrasted with other nations and races, we are at a
disadvantage. We have not the controlling influence of an academy. The
government cannot well take the initiative. If one party embraced it,
the other party would be fairly sure to set itself in opposition. This
would not be necessarily because of any dislike to the project itself,
but for the sake of making party capital. “If I were younger,” once
remarked Gladstone, speaking of the spelling, “I would gladly take
hold of this reform.” Had he done so, can any one doubt that whatever
scheme he proposed would have had arrayed against it all those who were
hostile to the views he advocated on other subjects, irrespective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
of any feelings they chanced to entertain on this particular one.
Political machinery, so constantly used to effect reforms, is
consequently barred. In every English-speaking country the general
government cannot well take any action, except under the impulse of a
popular demand too wide-spread and too powerful to be resisted. There
is, furthermore, in this country a special difficulty. In America it is
not the action of the general government that is of importance, but the
independent action of the several states. Even if reform were carried
through in some of them, there would always be danger of discordant
measures being taken in others.</p>

<p>Only one resource, therefore, is left to the men of English-speaking
countries. It is by the slow processes of discussion and agitation. The
great mass of men must be convinced by methods which will convey to
the general mind the truths that are known now only to the few. They
must be made to see both the desirableness and the practicability of
change before any wide-reaching results can be secured. They must be
made to see the futility of the arguments by which men seek to bolster
up the pretensions of the existing orthography; the waste of time and
efforts involved in its acquisition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span> and even in its use. More than
all—though this is a matter little touched upon—they must be made to
recognize the actual mental injury wrought to the young by its present
condition. The accomplishment of this is not merely a great work, but
in English-speaking lands it is one peculiarly difficult. In other
countries it is necessary to convince those who have more or less
studied the subject; for in their hands lies largely the control of the
machinery of education. But with us it is necessary to convince those
who are unfamiliar with the subject, and who not unfrequently have had
their ignorance strongly reinforced by prejudice. In the multitude of
these is found no small proportion of the educated class.</p>

This paper was then engaged in gathering the opinions of scholars and

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br><span class="small">ATTITUDE OF THE EDUCATED</span></h2></div>


<p>The unintelligent opposition of the intelligent! I have specified
this as the most formidable of the active forces hostile to reform of
English orthography. No duty is imposed upon those who have that end in
view more arduous than that of propagating knowledge among the educated
classes. It is hard to enlighten the ignorant man. But as regards this
particular subject, his mind is practically a blank page. As he has not
mastered the conventional spelling, he not only has no knowledge of it,
but he is aware that he has no knowledge of it. But in the case of the
educated man there is nothing of this open-mindedness. In his opinion
he knows already everything about the subject that can be known or that
is necessary to be known. It is only within a very recent period that
he has begun to suspect his limitations. Only within a recent period
has he exhibited any hesitation about exposing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span> the gaze of the
public the scantiness of the intellectual wardrobe with which he is
clad.</p>

<p>This imputation of ignorance of the subject has been much resented.
Nowhere has the resentment been keener than where the ignorance
is manifestly profoundest. To the fact itself not any opprobrium
necessarily attaches. No educated man considers it discreditable to
lack knowledge of the chemical constituents of the food he eats, or
of the things he sees and handles every day. If, indeed, because of
his familiarity with these objects, he fancies that he is competent
to form a judgment about their properties and draws conclusions as to
their use, then his course becomes objectionable. It is exactly so
in language. Pronunciation, and the proper way of representing it in
spelling, and the ways in which it has been represented at various
periods—these are subjects which demand long and severe study before
one has a right even to state facts. Naturally, still less has he a
right to draw conclusions. He who presumes to sit in judgment upon the
questions in controversy without having undergone this preliminary
training, no matter if he possess ability, has little reason to
complain if his pretensions meet with a good deal of contempt from
those who have paid even a comparatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span> slight attention to the
subject. That his utterances are received with favor by a public as
ignorant as himself is no evidence of his fitness to discuss the matter
in dispute. It is simply proof of the existence of that wide-spread
belief in the community, that because a person may have attained
deserved eminence in some field of literary activity, about which he
knows a great deal, he is therefore entitled to speak with authority in
some other field of which he knows little or nothing.</p>

<p>This unintelligent hostility of the intelligent is an obstacle
peculiarly difficult to overcome, because it is based upon the
combination of the minimum of knowledge with the maximum of prejudice.
These characteristics frequently meet, too, in those who on other
disputed subjects have the right to demand respectful attention to all
they choose to say. To this class belong many men of letters—not by
any means all of them, and far more of them in England than in America.
Some of these have made themselves conspicuous by the violence of their
utterances, some by the extent of their misapprehension of the question
at issue, and some by the display of a store of misinformation so vast
and varied that one gets the impression that no small share of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span> their
lives must have been spent in accumulating it. To many persons it does
not seem to occur that before discussing English orthography it is
desirable to equip one’s self with at least an elementary knowledge
of its character and history. As the acquisition of this preliminary
information is not deemed essential, there is little limit to the
surprising statements made upon this subject and the more surprising
facts by which they are fortified. The annals of fatuity will in truth
be searched in vain for utterances more fatuous than some of those
produced in the course of the controversy aroused by the President’s
order. There is a strong temptation to substantiate this assertion by
illustrating it from sayings and writings of those who took a part in
it opposed to spelling reform. But it is not desirable to impart to
the discussion of the subject a personal character by selecting such
examples from the utterances of living persons. That the statement
of the ignorance of men of letters is not unwarranted, however, can
be shown as well by bringing in the testimony of the dead. In this
instance it will be taken from an author of the past generation, of
highest literary eminence.</p>

<p>Many will remember an essay of Matthew Arnold on the influence of
academies, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span> panacea for all literary and linguistic ills so
constantly held before our eyes. According to him they raised the
general standard of knowledge so high that no one could wantonly run
counter to its requirements and escape with impunity. The force of
critical opinion would control the vagaries and correct the extravagant
assertions of the most learned. In the case of our own tongue he
adduced an illustration of the injury wrought to the language by the
lack of such a central authority. It was taken from what he told us was
one of those eccentric violations of correct orthography in which men
of our race wilfully indulge. The offender was the London <i>Times</i>.
That paper for a good part of the nineteenth century was addicted to
printing the word <i>diocese</i> as <i>diocess</i>.</p>

<p>This act aroused Arnold’s indignation. It is clear from his words that
resentment for the course of the London <i>Times</i> in this matter
had long been rankling in his bosom. A lawless practice of such a sort
could not have been possible, he felt, in a country where speech had
been subjected to the beneficial sway of an academy. Only in a land
where no restraining influence was exerted upon the performances of
the educated class could such a violation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span> linguistic knowledge and
literary good taste be permitted. Here are his words:</p>

<p>“So, again, with freaks in dealing with language; certainly all such
freaks tend to impair the power and beauty of language; and how
far more common they are with us than with the French! To take a
very familiar instance. Every one has noticed the way in which the
<i>Times</i> chooses to spell the word ‘diocese’; it always spells it
diocess, deriving it, I suppose, from <i>Zeus</i> and <i>census</i>.
The <i>Journal des Débats</i> might just as well write ‘diocess’
instead of ‘diocèse,’ but imagine the <i>Journal des Débats</i> doing
so! Imagine an educated Frenchman indulging himself in an orthographic
antic of this sort, in the face of the grave respect with which the
Academy and its dictionary invest the French language! Some people will
say these are little things. They are not; they are of bad example.
They tend to spread the baneful notion that there is no such thing as
a high correct standard in intellectual matters; that every one may as
well take his own way; they are at variance with the severe discipline
necessary for all real culture; they confirm us in habits of wilfulness
and eccentricity which hurt our minds and damage our credit with
serious people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>No one will question the earnestness with which these words are
spoken. The difficulty with them is that they are at variance with
the severe discipline necessary for all real culture—the discipline
which forbids us to discuss magisterially matters we know nothing
about. Consequently, they are of particularly bad example because
of the eminence of the writer. What are we to think of the opinions
of an author who could presume to express himself in this manner on
what he called correct orthography? Where did he get his knowledge
of that somewhat elusive substance? How was he enabled to pronounce
authoritatively on the proper spelling of a word about whose origin and
history he had not taken the slightest pains to inform himself? Arnold
supposed that the London <i>Times</i> may have derived <i>diocess</i>
from <i>Zeus</i> and <i>census</i>. Where did he himself think it came
from?</p>

<p>Still, as these words of his have been more than once triumphantly
quoted as an unintended, and therefore all the more crushing, argument
against spelling reform by a leading man of letters, it may be worth
while to give a brief account of the actual facts in regard to the
appearance of <i>diocese</i> in our speech, and the changes of form
it underwent—so far, at least,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span> as dictionaries of various periods
have recorded the usage. By so doing one may gain some conception of
the amount of research necessary to pronounce positively upon the
orthographic history of even a single word. He will further learn
to recognize the wisdom of refraining from the expression of large
judgments upon the correctness or incorrectness of a particular
spelling which are based upon limited knowledge. To clear the ground,
it is to be said—though it seems needless to say it—that the first
part of the word <i>diocese</i> has nothing to do with Zeus, though
one gets the impression that its genitive <i>Dios</i> was in some way
associated with it in Arnold’s mind. It comes remotely from a Greek
word meaning the management of a household. After its appearance in
our language in the fourteenth century, various were the forms it
assumed. Students of Chaucer are well aware that his spelling of
it was <i>diocise</i>. But it occurs but once in his writings, and
then as a ryme to <i>gyse</i>, the modern <i>guise</i>. Later, under
Latin influence, and for phonetic reasons, it became commonly either
<i>diocesse</i> or <i>dioces</i>.</p>

<p>Between these two forms the language seems finally to have made a
sort of compromise by recognizing the claims of both. It dropped the
<i>e</i> from the one or it added an <i>s</i> to the other, just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
as one is disposed to look at it. Though there were other forms,
<i>diocess</i> became accordingly the standard. Such it remained for
a long period. But its triumph was slow and, comparatively speaking,
late. <i>Diocesse</i> is the form given, for example, in Minsheu’s
<i>Guide to the Tongues</i>, which appeared in 1617. In Edward
Phillips’ dictionary of 1658, entitled <i>A New World of Words</i>,
it is <i>dioces</i>. But in later editions—certainly in that of
1696—<i>diocess</i> is the spelling found. Such also was the form of
the word in Bullokar’s dictionary of 1684; in the <i>Glossographia
Anglicana Nova</i> of 1719; and in Edward Cocker’s English dictionary
of 1724—the only editions of these works I have had the opportunity to
consult. On the other hand, in Coles’s English dictionary of 1713, it
is <i>diocese</i>. This is repeated in the edition of 1717. It is the
earliest instance I have met of the modern spelling, though others may
exist.</p>

<p>Before the publication of the dictionary of Dr. Johnson in 1755, the
two principal works of this character which the early part of the
eighteenth century produced were that of Bailey, and that of Dyche
improved and completed by Pardon. The former was the first to appear.
It indeed seems always to have outranked in popular estimation its
successor and rival. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span> came out first in 1721. Before the end of the
century it had passed through a very large number of editions. At the
outset its spelling of the word under consideration was <i>diocess</i>.
So it remained in the half dozen editions that followed. But after
1730 <i>diocese</i> took its place, and held it during the whole of
the eighteenth century. On the other hand, Dyche’s dictionary, which
began to be published in 1735, not only authorized <i>diocess</i>, but
clung to it in subsequent editions. Later in the century—certainly in
the seventeenth edition of 1794—it permitted the alternative spelling
<i>diocese</i>. This practice, indeed, can be met much earlier. For
instance, in the second edition of Benjamin Martin’s dictionary, which
appeared in 1754, both <i>diocese</i> and <i>diocess</i> are given.</p>

<p>It was the choice of <i>diocess</i> by Doctor Johnson that turned the
tide for a while in one direction. For the rest of the century it
settled the spelling, so far as the practice of most men was concerned.
He was followed by nearly all the later lexicographers. This was true
in particular of Sheridan and Walker. These two were widely accepted as
authorities, especially the latter. The edition of Walker’s dictionary,
which came out in 1802, just after his death, but containing his latest
revisions, was long regarded by our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span> fathers as a sort of orthographic
and orthoepic statute-book. It still showed <i>diocess</i> as the only
way of spelling this particular word. So did the dictionary of James
Sheridan Knowles, which was first published in 1835. It continued to
retain this form of the word in the editions of 1845 and 1877. It
is found even in the edition of Walker, as revised by Davis, which
appeared in 1861. On the other hand, Smart’s revision of the same
work, or remodelling, as he called it, was largely responsible for the
prevalence and general adoption of <i>diocese</i>. This dictionary was
first published in 1836. It had a wide circulation, and for a long
time its successive editions were regarded as authoritative works of
reference.</p>

<p>This survey of the matter is by no means exhaustive, but it is
sufficiently complete to render certain the results reached. It shows
that a long contest went on between the two forms of the word, and
that the later gradually triumphed over the earlier. It shows too
that <i>diocess</i>, though slowly going out of fashion, continued
still in the best of use long after Arnold had reached maturity. As
always happens, indeed, there was a certain body of conservatives who
refused to accept what was in their eyes the new-fangled monstrosity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
The ancient usage was good enough for them. Among these the London
<i>Times</i>, owing to its position in the newspaper world, occupied a
specially prominent place. It not impossibly felt that in standing by
the time-honored <i>diocess</i> it was resisting an insidious attempt
to ruin the language.</p>

<p>All, therefore, that Arnold needed to do, before expressing his
opinions, or rather his prejudices, in the matter was to learn these
easily accessible facts. To use his own phraseology, it was incumbent
upon him to let his mind play about the subject until he had fully
informed himself upon it. His failure to do this led him to fall into
the mistake he did. A note to the later edition of his essays conveys
the glad tidings that the London <i>Times</i> has at last renounced
the error of its ways, and has succumbed to the authority of fashion.
Like the rest of us, it now spells the word <i>diocese</i>. But the
irrevocable printed page will continue to stand and bear perpetual
witness to the blunder of its critic.</p>

<p>One is not, indeed, astonished at the lack of familiarity with the
facts just recorded on the part of a man of letters. They lie outside
of his particular province. They are not, indeed, generally known.
Nor are they in themselves so exciting as to attract the attention,
still less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span> the study, of anybody, without some external provocation.
Ignorance of them is, therefore, nothing discreditable. Indeed, we
may almost expect it from those who have made the study of literature
their pursuit in contradistinction to that of language. It gives
one, however, a sort of shock to find that this same ignorance has
been occasionally exhibited by linguistic scholars of the previous
generation. A kind of sanction is given to Arnold’s assertion by the
remark of Richard Gordon Latham on this same word <i>diocese</i>.
In his revision, published in 1871, of Todd’s edition of Johnson’s
dictionary, he observed under it that it was “once ignorantly spelled
<i>diocess</i>.” No wonder that the <i>Times</i> succumbed to this
combined attack of learning and letters marching under a common banner
of inadequate investigation and erroneous assertion.</p>

<p>I have gone at great length into the consideration of this particular
example, not entirely from the eminence of the author who chose to
furnish it. As much were these details supplied in order to make
manifest how patient and protracted must be the study which will
authorize any one to pronounce decisively upon a question of disputed
spelling. As long as the advocates of the existing orthography confine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
themselves merely to the expression of their prejudices and opinions,
they are comparatively safe, even though their prejudices have no
foundation in reason and their opinions have behind them no trace of
investigation. The moment, however, they attempt to fortify their
notions by illustrations and argument, they are lost.</p>

<p>This is the moral of the tale told of Arnold. There are circumstances
in which no amount of genius can make up for the lack of a little
accurate knowledge. It is not often given to an essayist to exemplify
himself a practice he vehemently condemns in the very paragraph
containing the condemnation. If academies really exerted the power
with which Arnold credited them; if they could exercise a controlling
influence over public opinion; if they could establish so broad a basis
of intelligence that men would be prevented from giving utterance to
crude and hasty dicta; if they could keep writers from palming off
upon the public the results of imperfect knowledge acting through the
medium of perfect prejudice—if these things were so, it is quite clear
that in this particular instance it would have been the utterances of
Matthew Arnold that would have been suppressed, and not the assumed
orthographical vagaries of the London <i>Times</i>. In Germany,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span> where
there is no academy, but where there is a broad and lofty level of
linguistic intelligence, observations of a similar character would have
met with immediate and crushing exposure and censure. In England and
America, where there is a broad and deep level of linguistic ignorance,
this blundering statement has long been hailed by many as a proper
rebuke to the miscreants who are seeking to defile the sacred altar of
English orthography.</p>

<p>An extravagant outburst like the one just cited—it could easily be
paralleled from recent utterances—coming from a man occupying a far
higher position than any literary defender of the present spelling,
reveals what a fathomless abyss of ignorance and prejudice must be
filled up or bridged over before there can be even a calm discussion
of the subject by the mass of educated men. If we are unable to treat
with respect the utterances of great men who are capable of falling
into errors like the one just exposed, how can we be expected to be
impressed by the words of little men who cite these easily detected
blunders as an authoritative justification for their own hostility?
Because they deal with language as an art, they fancy they know
all about it as a science. There is no intention of conveying the
impression that men of letters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span> are more remarkable than others for
erroneous assertions on this subject. As a class they are probably
less so. In their ranks, too, are to be found some of the most earnest
sympathizers with the movement for the simplification of the spelling.
These, too, stand in the first rank. It must not be assumed, therefore,
that those among them who have gained an unenviable notoriety by the
blunders into which they have fallen in opposing it are more ignorant
than other men. They have simply had furnished them by their position
unequalled opportunities to make their ignorance conspicuous.</p>

<p>Now, to any real student of the subject, it is evident that both
in French and in English the most conservative of courses has been
contemplated and taken, so far as any change in orthography has been
recommended. No attempt has been made to introduce phonetic spelling.
Any intention of that sort has been distinctly disclaimed by those
among us who have set the reform on foot. Yet it is a charge from
which they have been unable to escape. One of the most striking as
well as most entertaining features of the controversy that went on
was the persistent assertion of those concerned in the movement, that
they had no design or desire to introduce phonetic spelling;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span> and the
equally persistent assertion of their assailants that it was the very
thing they were aiming to introduce. One side laid down precisely
what it sought to do. The other side denounced it for doing the
very thing it disclaimed doing. One side declared that it purposely
limited its efforts to the removal of some of the anomalies in our
present orthography, and the obstacles put by these in the way of its
acquisition. The other employed two methods of attack: on the one hand,
it inveighed against its opponents for going as far as they did; on the
other, it reproached them for their inconsistency in not going further.</p>

<p>Any one who has the slightest conception of what a reform of our
spelling on pure phonetic principles means will absolve those
now urging reform from putting forward any scheme of that sort.
It requires, indeed, a singular innocence of all knowledge of
this particular subject to make such a charge. Certain changes
recommended would, indeed, have brought particular words nearer a
phonetic standard. But if everything proposed were to be universally
adopted—and even ten times more—the real disease which afflicts our
orthography would be but partially alleviated. It would do little more
than set us on the road to a thorough-going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span> reform. No one, indeed,
who comprehends what is required, in a language so lawless as ours,
to bring about a perfect accordance between orthography and orthoepy,
is ever likely to underrate the difficulties which stand in the way
of the establishment of phonetic spelling, even were men as eager for
its adoption as they are now hostile to it. In the present state of
feeling, therefore, no one need distress himself about its immediate
coming.</p>

<p>But why should any one distress himself at all? Little is there more
extraordinary to witness in these days of assumed general enlightenment
than the horror which many estimable persons seem to feel at the danger
of being devoured by this dreadful ogre which they call phonetic
spelling. They have no idea what it is, but they know from its name
that it must be something frightful. Now, written language was designed
to be phonetic. Its intention, however incomplete its realization,
was to represent invariably the same sound by the same letter or by
the same combination of letters. This idea lies at the root of the
conception of the alphabet; otherwise the alphabet would have had no
reason for its existence. To picture to the eye the sound which has
fallen upon the ear, so that it should never be mistaken for anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
else, was the problem that presented itself to the man or men who
devised that invention which, imperfect as it is, still remains the
greatest and most useful to which the human mind has given birth. To
represent a sound by one character in one place and by another in
another would have seemed to them as absurd as it would to a painter
to have the figure of a horse stand for a horse in one picture, and in
another picture for a different animal. Of course, in this comparison
the symbol is in one case real, and in the other arbitrary; but the
underlying principle is the same.</p>

<p>So far as the original invention of the alphabet failed to secure the
individual representation of every sound then used, the invention was
itself incomplete and imperfect. So far, again, as the characters
of the alphabet have been diverted from their original design of
representing particular sounds, it is not an application of the
invention, but a perversion of it to inferior purposes, and to purposes
for which it is not really fitted. One general statement applicable to
all languages can be safely made. So far as written speech deviates
from the phonetic standard, it fails to fulfil the object for which it
was created. It shows to what an extent the English race has wandered
away in feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span> and opinion from the original motives which led men
to seek the representation of the spoken word by written characters,
that its members have come to look upon the perfect accordance of
orthography and orthoepy as a result, not merely impracticable—which
is a thoroughly defensible proposition—but as something in itself
undesirable, as something fraught with ruin to the speech itself. The
written word was devised to suggest the sound of the spoken word. Yet
this ideal is more than discredited with us; it is treated as if it
were in some way peculiarly monstrous. Yet all there is of value in
our existing orthography is due to what still survives of the phonetic
element. This is a condition of things which will be brought out fully
when the orthographic situation comes to be considered.</p>

<p>The real life of a language consists in its sounds, not in the signs
intended to represent them. The one is the soul of speech; the other
can hardly be considered a necessary bodily framework, for the former
could and does exist without the latter. In earlier times, when
language was learned almost exclusively by the ear, this fact would
naturally force itself upon the attention of every reflecting man.
But with the spread of education, when acquaintance with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span> a tongue
is acquired largely through the eye, the knowledge of the symbolic
representation of sounds has come to predominate in the minds of the
men of our race over the knowledge of the sounds themselves. While all
of us are familiar with the one, but few are with the other. Ask any
person of ordinary attainments the number of letters in the English
alphabet. He will unhesitatingly answer twenty-six; though the chances
are that he will be ignorant of the fact that some of the twenty-six
are really supernumerary. But extend the inquiry further. Go with
it to the vast body of educated men, excluding those whose pursuits
require of them more or less the study of phonetics. These being
excepted, ask any single person belonging to the most highly cultivated
class—opponents of spelling reform to be preferred—how many are the
sounds which the letters of the alphabet and their combinations are
called upon to represent. Ask him how many are the sounds which he is
in the habit of employing himself in his own utterance. The chances are
fifty to one that he will be utterly at a loss what to reply. He has
learned the symbols of things; he has not learned the things themselves.</p>

<p>That this should be so in the case of our own tongue is not
particularly surprising. It is, perhaps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span> inevitable. The attention
of the men of our race has been more than distracted from any
consideration of the subject by the character of our orthography.
Their minds have been thrown into a state of bewilderment. As a
single illustration, take the representation of the sound usually
termed “long <i>i</i>.” This third so-called vowel of our alphabet
is not really a vowel, but a diphthong. Its sound is most commonly
represented by the single letter itself, seen, for instance, in such
a word as <i>mind</i>. But some idea of the uncertainty and range
attending its use, with the consequent perplexity to its users,
can be gathered from a few selected examples. It is represented by
<i>ai</i> in <i>aisle</i>; by <i>ay</i> in <i>aye</i>; by <i>ei</i>
in <i>height</i>; by <i>ey</i> in <i>eye</i>; by <i>ie</i> in
<i>lie</i>; by <i>oi</i> in <i>choir</i>; by <i>uy</i> in <i>buy</i>;
by <i>y</i> in <i>try</i>; and by <i>ye</i> in <i>dye</i>. Or, reverse
the operation, and see how many sounds the same sign can represent.
Take the combination <i>ou</i>, and observe the differences of its
pronunciation in the words <i>about</i>, <i>young</i>, <i>youth</i>,
<i>four</i>, <i>fought</i>, <i>would</i>, and <i>cough</i>.</p>

<p>English orthography, therefore, instead of teaching the
English-speaking man the knowledge and distinction of sounds, takes the
speediest and most effectual means of preventing his attaining any such
knowledge. It not merely fails to call his attention to it, it forces
him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span> disregard it, to look upon it as an element not properly to be
considered. He does not come to forget, he has never learned to know
that there is a particular value that belongs or ought to belong to any
vowel or combination of vowels. When he grows up, he is naturally ready
to despise what he is unable to comprehend. The educated class has
with us come generally to look upon the alphabet as a mere mechanical
contrivance. They have so largely lost sight of the object for which
it exists, that in many cases they are almost disposed to resent the
proposition that they should employ it for the purposes for which it
was created. It would be thinking too meanly of human nature to believe
that men would delight in this condition of things did they once come
fully to appreciate it. But to that point few of them ever arrive.
Accordingly, ignorance of the real evil disposes them to look with
distrust upon any attempt to remedy it.</p>

<p>In truth, as a consequence of the confusion which exists in the written
speech, the English race, as a race, has no acquaintance whatever with
sounds. It has largely lost the phonetic sense. One whole important
domain of knowledge, which ought to have come to it through the
spelling, has entirely disappeared from recognition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span> without their
being aware of it. Examples of the prevalent lack of any conception
of the distinction of sounds and of their proper representation are
brought constantly to the attention of those engaged in the work of
instruction. But the comments and communications which appear in the
course of any controversy on spelling reform, especially those intended
to be satirical, furnish the most striking illustrations of this
all-prevailing, all-pervading ignorance. There is rarely furnished a
more edifying spectacle than the attempt made, in some cases by men of
very genuine ability, to write what they call phonetically. In every
discussion there are sure to come up with unfailing regularity certain
examples that indicate the density of the darkness in which the minds
of men are enveloped. Several years ago a series of articles appeared
in a Western periodical attacking the reform of the orthography.
In one of them occurred this observation: “We are asked,” said the
author, “to spell <i>are</i> without the <i>e</i>, because the letter
is not pronounced. Very well: then drop the <i>a</i>, for that is not
pronounced either.” In the same spirit the writer went on to say that
fanatical advocates of change should denote the words <i>see</i> and
<i>sea</i> simply by <i>c</i>—“spelling only the letter sounded.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>Here was a person producing a series of articles on orthography who was
so utterly unacquainted with the primary elemental facts of orthoepy
as to fancy that the sound of r and of c by themselves is the same
as the name we give to those letters; who did not know that the name
cannot be pronounced unless a vowel precedes the <i>r</i> in one case
and follows the <i>c</i> in the other. Exactly the same examples were
adduced in the course of the latest controversy. It is perfectly
clear that not one of those who made use of them had the slightest
conception of what was essential to convey the representation of a
given sound. Any arbitrary symbol, pronounced in a particular way,
seemed to them all-sufficient. Their action evinced hardly higher
intelligence than would have been shown by considering the word
<i>five</i> as phonetically represented by the Arabic numeral 5, which
in all languages conveys the same meaning, and in all languages has
a different pronunciation. One characteristic there is which denotes
most distinctly the infantile state of knowledge that still continues
to prevail on the whole subject. By most men any bad spelling is
invariably termed phonetic spelling. That is all the idea of the
latter they have. The spelling of Chaucer would in their eyes be
indistinguishable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span> in character from that of Josh Billings.</p>

<p>More than once have advocates of spelling reform been rebuked for the
arrogance manifested by them in their references to the inaccurate
assertions and loose thinking which largely make up the chatter of the
uninformed on this subject. On the contrary, much of this gabble seems
to me to have been treated with singular leniency. Especially has this
been the case when it comes from men who have shown knowledge on other
subjects and ability in other directions. These have too often missed
opportunities, which were fairly obtrusive, of remaining silent on this
matter. But no such forbearance is due to the rank and file of the
noisy intruders into a controversy they do not understand. There was
a writer who gravely informed us that it is an insuperable objection
to a change in our orthography, that it would make necessary a new
formative period in the history of the language. For fear that the full
force of this terrible indictment should be overlooked, he proceeded
to put the words containing it in italics. What possible conception
could exist in the mind of such an objector as to what constitutes a
formative period in the history of a language? Does spelling reform
introduce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span> new words? Does it give new meanings to old ones? Does it
destroy existing inflections? Does it add any to their number? Does
it vary in the slightest the order of words in the sentence? Does it
cause the least modification of the least important rule of syntax? A
new spelling meaning a new language! Fancy a boy refusing to wash his
face, on the ground that if the dirt were removed he would not be the
same boy. Fancy a man objecting to putting on a new suit of clothes,
on the ground that by so doing he could never be again what he was
before; that the integrity of his character and the continuity of his
traditions would be destroyed; that he would no longer be the same
man to those who had known him and loved him. This is not a travesty
of the argument which has been advanced. It is the argument itself,
applied not to the dress of the body, but to that of the speech. The
men who hold such opinions are really in the same grade of intellectual
development as regards language, as in literature are those who fancy
that beginning a line with a capital letter is the one essential thing
which constitutes poetry.</p>

<p>But of all the educated opponents of spelling reform, I have to confess
that the most entertaining to me are women. As devotion to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span> present
orthography is a matter of sentiment and not one of reason, it is
perhaps not strange that some of the most violent opponents of the
present movement are to be found among the members of that sex with
which appeals addressed to the feelings are peculiarly potent. It
must not, however, be assumed for a moment that this characterization
is meant to apply to all women. On the contrary, among them can be
found not only many of the most earnest advocates of reform, but an
especially large proportion of the most intelligent and clear-headed.
This observation is particularly true of those of them who are
connected directly or indirectly with the profession of teaching. To
the hands of women, indeed, the business of the instruction of the
very young is almost entirely committed. They make themselves familiar
with the character of the orthography from the side of both theory and
practice. They have, in consequence, forced upon their attention, as
have few men, the absurdities and anomalies of our present spelling,
the unnecessary and utterly irrational obstacles it puts in the path
of the learner; the time and toil which must be spent, or rather
wasted, in mastering rules to which the exceptions are as numerous as
the examples, and in which exceptions abound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span> to the exceptions. The
intelligent among them naturally come to know whereof they speak, and
to have decided opinions born of experience and observation.</p>

<p>But experience and observation of this sort have not been forced
upon the majority of even educated women. Acquaintance with the real
nature of our orthography is not, in their eyes, a matter of intrinsic
importance. Accordingly, in the case of those who feel intensely on
this subject and exhibit a virulent hostility toward reform of the
spelling, we can observe the peculiar mental effervescence which is
produced when the maximum of emotion is allowed to operate upon the
minimum of knowledge. With them the question is not at all one of
argument. It is entirely one of taste, as they regard taste; though
occasionally there seems to be an honest even if unfounded belief
that arguments have been employed. It is their sensibilities that are
outraged, not their reason. I confess to liking the attitude of these
opponents of spelling reform, and to receiving gratification from their
extremest utterances. They are entirely free from the sham in which
men indulge, of pretending to be influenced in their beliefs on this
subject by logical principles. Sojourning in that upper rarefied air of
sentiment in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span> common-sense staggers and reason swoons, there is
an indefinable charm in the irrationality they display in resolutely
ignoring facts they find inconvenient to consider and arguments they
disdain to comprehend.</p>

<p>No pleasure, indeed, can be conceived more delightful than in listening
to the discussion of this subject by its female opponents. As this
is largely a book of personal confessions, I may be permitted to say
that I like to hear them talk and to read what they write. They feel
about reform of the spelling as did in another way certain of their
high-born sisters who have left behind memorials of their experiences
when the great cataclysm of the French revolution took place. It was
apparently not the scenes of horror and massacre that shocked these
scions of noble families; not the victims carted in tumbrils to the
guillotine; not the fusillades which swept the streets and stained the
pavements with the blood of those who felt fighting for the old régime.
Nor was it the question of right or wrong, of relieving oppression,
of establishing justice. Not one of these things seems to have made a
particular impression upon their minds. What really affected them was
something altogether different. The revolution was in such bad taste.
Men like Danton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span> and his associates did not behave in a gentlemanly
way. They were not really nice. Just so—if we can compare small things
with great—is the impression one gets of the attitude of many women
who are hostile to the new spellings proposed. Such may be nearer the
pronunciation. They may be nearer the derivation or some other old
thing for which nobody cares. But these new spellings are not really
nice.</p>

<p>This devotion of woman to the fixed orthography is largely a modern
sentiment. There was little of it in the past, either in theory or
practice. In fact, high position and sex were once largely regarded
as entitling those belonging to either to be exempt from orthographic
trammels. Richardson represents Charlotte Grandison as describing one
of her lovers as “spelling pretty well for a lord.” But in this same
particular several of the most noted women in the past have also been
defective. There was nothing then of the superstition of the sacredness
of the orthography which now prevails. They apparently did not deem it
possible to secure the leisure to make themselves as attractive as they
wished to be, were they compelled to waste their time in memorizing
the exact spelling of words whose forms they had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span> sense to see
exhibited no sense. As time went on their indifference not unfrequently
came to disturb those of their lords and masters who were getting to
be punctilious on this point. Swift, who in one way or another was
always in a state of anxiety about the English language, had frequent
occasion to chasten Stella on the subject. “I drink no aile (I suppose
you mean ale),” he writes to her under date of September 29, 1710.
“Who are these wiggs,” he asks again on October 8, “who think I am
turned Tory? Do you mean Whigs?” “Pray, Stella,” he says, in April of
the following year, “explain those two words of yours to me, what you
mean by <i>Villian</i> and <i>Dainger</i>.” “R<i>e</i>diculous, madam?”
he expostulated, on another occasion; “I suppose you mean ridiculous:
let me have no more of that; it is the author of the <i>Atlantis’</i>
spelling.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> One infers from this remark that the then noted Mrs.
Manley was as notorious for the scandalous form in which her words
appeared in her manuscript as she was for the scandalous meaning they
conveyed when appearing in print.</p>

<p>One could fill page after page with the extraordinary views on spelling
reform which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span> have come from men and women of education and sometimes
of genuine ability. The controversy, indeed, which has been going on of
late has brought out more sharply than ever before the existence of the
singular situation which prevails in regard to it. The highly trained
expert opinion is practically all on one side; the large preponderance
of educated lay opinion is apparently on the other. Several eminent
men have taken part in the discussion in opposition to change. But in
all their ranks cannot be found a single one who would be recognized
by special students of English as entitled to speak with authority.
Not a single one of the latter class has come forward in opposition.
Some of them are very possibly indifferent; but so far as they have
spoken—and many have spoken—they have pronounced in its favor. If
there is among them one who entertains hostility, he is sufficiently in
awe of his professional brethren to deem it wise to keep his opinion
to the sanctity of private intercourse. No applause of the multitude
could make up to him for the condemnation that would be his from his
peers. By ranging himself among the opponents of spelling reform he
would be well aware that he would distinctly lose caste. He would be
placed in a dilemma on one of whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span> two horns he would be impaled. He
would be looked upon as guilty either of lack of knowledge or of lack
of judgment.</p>

<p>This is a state of things that could not well exist in the case of
any other subject than language. Nor, indeed, could it well happen
with any other race than the English, where on both sides of the
Atlantic ignorance of our tongue and of its history has been sedulously
cultivated for centuries. Accordingly, the raggedest of penny-a-liners
or the callowest of story-tellers considers himself as much entitled
to speak with authority on the subject as he who has devoted years of
study to its consideration. Of course, this is a state of things that
cannot continue permanently. In the long run the opinions of the few
who know will triumph over the clamors of the many who do not know.
Indeed, a distinct advance has already been achieved. The subject is
no longer treated with indifference. It calls forth hostile criticism,
ridicule, vituperation. Furthermore, certain things can no more be
said which were once said with smug satisfaction. We are now a long
way beyond that provincial faith in Worcester which permitted, fifty
years ago, so eminent a man of letters as Oliver Wendell Holmes to
remark that Boston had for one of its distinctions “its correct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span> habit
of spelling the English language.” In these days an author of his
high grade would be saved by his inevitable association with English
scholars from perpetrating an observation so singularly crude. Views
of such a sort now find their home only in the congenial clime of the
remote rural districts. For slow as has been the progress in this
matter, it has been steady. In the immediate future it is destined to
advance at a much more rapid rate. The leading universities of America
are regularly sending out a small body of trained special students
of our speech. In the face of this steadily increasing number of
experts whose opinions are based upon adequate investigation and full
knowledge, sciolists will in time conclude for their own safety to
learn a little before they talk much.</p>

<p>Yet, neither now nor in the past has the advocacy of spelling reform
been confined to the specialists in English study. It has embraced
scholars of all lands who paid attention to our language or to some
form of its literature. Long ago Grimm pointed out that the greatest
obstacle to the predominating influence of the English tongue was
the character of its orthography. But without going so far back, let
us select as types of advocates of reform three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span> representative men
of the generation which has just passed away. They are Professor Max
Müller, of Oxford; Professor Child, of Harvard; and Professor Whitney,
of Yale. Of course, these scholars were cranks—“crazy cranks,” if
you will. Much learning had made them mad—insanity from that cause
being something from which the critics of their orthographical views
feel the sense of absolute immunity. Of course, we know further that
professors are a simple, guileless folk, constantly imposed upon by
arguments whose speciousness is at once seen by the clearer vision of
the men engaged in the struggle and turmoil of practical life. To them
unhappily has never been given the easy omniscience which is enabled to
understand the whole of a subject without mastering a single one of its
details. Still, as a member of this unpractical fraternity, and sharing
in its intellectual limitations, I cannot get over the impression
that there are difficulties connected with English orthography which
even the very youngest newspaper writer cannot settle summarily, and
questions which he cannot answer satisfactorily offhand.</p>

<p>In truth, the real nature of our spelling and the real difficulties
connected with its reformation are not in the least understood by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
vast majority of the educated class. Otherwise it would be impossible
for men, sometimes of genuine ability, to give public utterance to the
views they entertain. One has only to read articles in magazines and
communications sent to the newspapers to gain a view both vivid and
depressing of the wide-spread ignorance that prevails. It is manifest,
indeed, that the nature of these difficulties is not always understood,
even by those who are earnest in their desire for reform of some kind.
Accordingly, before the subject can be discussed intelligently, some
knowledge of the general orthographic situation must be secured. The
irrepressible conflict that goes on in our speech between spelling and
pronunciation can never be really appreciated, save by him who has
mastered a portion at least of the details in which that conflict has
reached its highest degree of intensity.</p>

<p>To set these details forth is anything but an agreeable task. The
subject of sounds and the methods taken to represent them cannot, by
the wildest stretch of the imagination, be termed exhilarating. But
some notion of it must be gained by him who seeks to get any conception
of what must be deemed the main trouble affecting English orthography.
This is the reason,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span> and to some must be the excuse, for presenting
the results of a piece of drudgery as wearisome as it is thankless.
The dose I shall try to make as palatable as possible; but there is no
disguising the fact that it is a dose. But it is only by swallowing it,
or something akin to it, that men can get any conception of the real
evils that afflict English spelling, and of the methods that must be
taken to palliate them; for in the present state of public opinion,
it is hopeless to attempt to cure them. To a consideration of the
orthographic situation the next chapter will therefore be devoted.</p>

<h3>I<br><span class="small">THE PROBLEM</span></h3>

<p>It is with a good deal of hesitation that I approach this part of my
subject. To treat it fully, to consider it in all its details, would
require a familiarity with the history of sounds, with their precise
values, and with the proper way of representing these values, to which
I can lay no claim. Though I have given some time to the study of this
branch of the general question, I am well aware that my knowledge of
it is not the knowledge of a professional, but of an amateur. It is
only when I read the attempts of the assailants of spelling reform to
write what they are pleased to call phonetically, that my own slender
acquaintance with this field of research looms up momentarily before
my eyes as endowed with colossal proportions. Fortunately, intimate
familiarity with this particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span> part of the subject is not needed for
the end had here in view. To point out the evils afflicting our present
system is possible for him who is unable to prescribe a remedy. This is
the special task which I set before myself in this section.</p>

<p>It is essential, in the first place, to have clearly before our minds
the nature of the problem with which we are called upon to deal. The
general statement about it may be and often is summarized in a few
words. We are told that in English the same sound is represented by
half a dozen signs, and the same sign is used to denote half a dozen
sounds. This is all true. Unfortunately, to the vast majority of men
it conveys no definite idea. It certainly would not bring clearly
before them much conception of the real difficulty. Some of them would
even be puzzled to explain what is meant here by the word <i>sign</i>.
Most of them have no knowledge whatever of the number and quality of
the sounds they use. This remark is not intended as a reproach. Their
condition of ignorance is due to no fault of their own. The existing
orthography does not content itself with hiding from the ordinary eye
all knowledge of phonetic law; it puts a stumbling-block in the way
of its acquisition. Accordingly, it does more than permit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span> ignorance
of the subject; it fosters it. Men are not led to consider even the
most aggressively prominent facts of their own utterance. I have known
intelligent young persons, of much more than ordinary ability, who
had never learned as a matter of knowledge that the digraph <i>th</i>
has two distinct sounds; that were <i>thin</i> pronounced as is
<i>then</i>, or <i>then</i> as is <i>thin</i>, we should have in each
case another word than the one we actually possess. They had never
confused the two in their usage, but as little had they been in the
habit of remarking the difference between them. Consequently, when it
was brought directly to their attention, it came upon them as a sort
of surprise. If a distinction which lies on the very surface could
so easily escape notice, what hope can be entertained of gaining a
realizing sense of those subtler ones which abound on every side?</p>

<p>The first point, therefore, to be made emphatic is that there is a
large number of sounds in the speech and but a limited number of signs
in the alphabet. The number of sounds has been variously estimated. It
depends a good deal upon the extent to which the orthoepic investigator
is disposed to recognize differences more or less subtle and the
weight he assigns to each. In general, it may be said that usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
the lowest number given is thirty-eight, and the highest forty-four.
A very common estimate puts them at forty-two. Exactness on this
point is not necessary for the purpose here aimed at, and for the
sake of convenience the whole number of sounds will be temporarily
assumed to be forty, more or less. To represent these forty sounds we
have nominally twenty-six letters. Really we have but twenty-three.
Either <i>c</i> or <i>k</i> is supernumerary, as are also <i>x</i> and
<i>q</i>.</p>

<p>Here, then, lies the initial difficulty. The Roman alphabet we have
adopted has not a sufficient number of letters to do the duty required
of it. For us its inability has been further aggravated by the loss
of two signs which the language had originally, or acquired early in
its history. For the disappearance of these there was later in another
quarter a partial compensation in the differentiation of <i>i</i> and
<i>j</i>, and of <i>u</i> and <i>v</i>. Of the two vanished signs
one was a Rune, called “thorn” or the “thorn letter,” þ, the other
a crossed <i>d</i>, represented by ð. They were or could be used
to represent the surd or hard initial sound heard in <i>thin</i>
just mentioned, and the corresponding sonant or soft sound heard in
<i>then</i>. These two letters, unknown to the Roman alphabet, were
allowed to die out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span> of general use in the fifteenth century. Of both
the digraph <i>th</i> took the place. Yet in one way the so-called
thorn letter has left behind a memorial of itself. Its form had
something of a resemblance to the black-letter character <i>y</i>.
Consequently, when “thorn” ceased to be used, <i>y</i> was at times
substituted for it. Especially was this true in the case of the words
<i>the</i> and <i>that</i>. These were frequently printed as <i>yᵉ</i>
and <i>yᵗ</i>. This form of the latter word disappeared after a while,
not merely from use, but practically from remembrance. <i>Ye</i>,
however, in the sense of <i>the</i>, but with its initial letter given
the sound of <i>y</i>, is fondly cherished and sometimes employed by
certain persons, who indulge in the delusion that by so doing they are
writing and talking Old English.</p>

<p>The use of this one digraph to represent these two distinct sounds
inevitably tends to create uncertainty of pronunciation, if not to
produce confusion. We can see this fact exemplified in the case of such
words as <i>tithe</i> and <i>path</i> and <i>oath</i> and <i>mouth</i>.
In these <i>th</i> has in the singular the surd sound, in the plural
the sonant. The proper way of pronouncing them has therefore to be
learned carefully in each individual instance, for there is nothing
in the spelling to indicate it. Usage in truth is very fluctuating
with respect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span> to some of the words in which this digraph appears. In
consequence, the question of their pronunciation begets at times much
controversy. Still, compared with the uncertainty attending other
signs, the perplexities caused by this are of slight importance.</p>

<p>The lack of a sufficient number of signs to indicate the sounds is
therefore the first difficulty to be encountered. But this is a defect
which English shares with several tongues which have adopted the Roman
alphabet. There is another characteristic which belongs to our language
exclusively. This is the progressive movement which has gone on in
the case of some of the vowel-sounds. In the historic development of
English pronunciation several of these have lost their original values.
This has caused them not merely to deviate from the sounds they once
had in our own speech, but has also brought them out of harmony with
those of the cultivated tongues of modern Europe. In none of these
have the original values experienced any such disturbance. Such a
condition of things is so peculiar to our language, it complicates
the whole orthographic situation so thoroughly, that it demands first
consideration in any discussion of the various problems that need to be
solved.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span> Let us give briefly, then, the most important facts in regard
to the changes which have taken place in the history of these sounds.</p>


<h3>II<br><span class="small">MOVEMENT OF VOWEL-SOUNDS</span></h3>

<p>The first vowel-sound of the alphabet—the <i>a</i> heard in
<i>father</i> and <i>far</i>—has been aptly styled “the fundamental
vowel-tone of the human voice.” But the noticeable fact about it in
English is that it has not only gone largely out of use already, but
that it tends to go out of use more and more. Once the most common
of articulate utterances, it has now become one of the rarest. In
reducing the employment of it English has gone beyond all other modern
cultivated tongues. The decline in its use has been steady. “In the
Sanskrit,” says Whitney, “in its long and short forms it makes over
seventy per cent. of the vowels and about thirty per cent. of the whole
alphabet.” In examining his own utterance he rated the frequency of
its occurrence at a little more than half of one per cent. This may be
taken as fairly representative of the fortunes which have generally
befallen the sound. Different parts of the English-speaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span> world
preserve it, indeed, in different degrees. In Great Britain—if I can
take as typical of all persons the pronunciation of it furnished to my
own ears by a few—it is retained more fully than in the United States.
But even there it has for a long period been disappearing. There is no
reason to suppose that with our present orthography this process will
not continue to go on.</p>

<p>The loss of this sound would assuredly be a great calamity to the
speech. The coming of that day may be distant; it is to be hoped
that it will never come at all. Yet owing to the incapacity of our
orthography to represent pronunciation strictly, and therefore hold it
fast permanently, the sound is certainly in danger of following to the
very end the road on which it has long been travelling. It shows every
sign of steady though slow disappearance. Once it was heard generally
in many classes of words where it is now never heard at all. Such, for
instance, was the case when <i>a</i> was followed by <i>n</i>, as in
<i>answer</i>, <i>chance</i>, <i>dance</i>, <i>plant</i>; by <i>f</i>,
as in <i>after</i>; by <i>s</i>, as in <i>grass</i>, <i>glass</i>,
<i>pass</i>; by <i>st</i>, as in <i>last</i> and <i>vast</i>. More
than a century ago the lexicographer Walker contended that this sound
must formerly have been always heard in these and such like words,
because it was “still the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span> sound given to them by the vulgar, who are
generally the last to alter the common pronunciation.” There can be
little doubt of the fact. In truth, Doctor Johnson distinctly specified
<i>rather</i>, <i>fancy</i>, <i>congratulate</i>, <i>glass</i> among
others as having it. Walker added that “the short <i>a</i> in these
words”—those mentioned above—“is now the general pronunciation of the
polite and learned world.” Hence, he felt justified in asserting that
the ancient sound “borders very closely on vulgarity.”</p>

<p>This same result is showing itself in the instances where the vowel is
followed by other letters or combinations of letters. Before <i>lf</i>
and <i>th</i>—which can be illustrated respectively by <i>calf</i>,
<i>half</i>, and by <i>path</i>, <i>bath</i>—the original sound, once
generally heard, has given way largely and is still giving way. There
are certainly many parts of the English-speaking world where the older
pronunciation of it would be the exception and not the rule. The most
effective agent in retaining it is a following <i>r</i>. In this case
the sound is heard in no small number of words, as may be seen, for
illustration, in <i>bar</i> and <i>car</i>. Another agency working
for its retention, though far less powerful than the preceding, is a
following <i>l</i>, as in <i>balm</i> and <i>calm</i>. But in this
second case the sound is even now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span> threatened with extinction. It
exhibits in many places weakness of hold upon the utterance. Hence,
it may come to take the road already trodden by other words in which
it once showed itself. In the case of some of these, as a result of
diminishing use, the sound, when heard, for illustration, in words
like <i>half</i> and <i>calf</i>, is already looked upon by many as an
affectation. Should such a feeling about it come not only to exist but
to prevail when the vowel is followed by <i>lm</i>, its doom would be
sealed. To hear <i>psalm</i> pronounced as the proper name <i>Sam</i>
is still hateful to the orthoepically pure. Such a usage can as yet
be politely termed a provincialism, or, insultingly, a vulgarism. Yet
against the levelling tendency of an orthography which does not protect
pronunciation, it is possible that the earlier sound of <i>a</i> in
these words may not be able to hold out forever.</p>

<p>So much for the first vowel of the alphabet. We are as badly off,
though in a different way, when we come to the second. It emphasizes
the degeneracy which has overtaken our whole orthographic and orthoepic
system that the name we now give to the first vowel was originally and
still is scientifically the long sound of the second. The respective
short and long values of this are heard in the words <i>met</i> and
<i>mate</i>. In them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span> are indicated the two sounds which the second
vowel once had with us, and which it still retains in other cultivated
tongues. The short sound continues to exist in all its primitive vigor,
but the long sound is now very generally denoted by <i>a</i>. <i>E</i>
itself no longer has it, save in the exclamation <i>eh</i>, and in
certain cases where it is followed by <i>i</i> or <i>y</i>, such as
<i>vein</i> and <i>rein</i>, and <i>they</i> or <i>obey</i>. Perhaps,
indeed, it would be better to say that, strictly speaking, this letter
by itself never indicates the sound at all; for the digraphs <i>ei</i>
and <i>ey</i>, as we shall see later, have various distinct values, and
are therefore entitled to be considered independently.</p>

<p>A condition of things not essentially dissimilar can be reported of
the next vowel. Its original corresponding short and long sounds would
be exactly represented by those heard in the words <i>fill</i> and
<i>feel</i>. But the same transition or progression which has waited
upon the second vowel has also attended the third. Its proper long
sound has now become the name by which we regularly designate the
second vowel. The fortunes of <i>i</i> have accordingly been about
the same as those of its predecessor <i>e</i>. Here again the genuine
short sound has been preserved in its integrity and on a large scale.
But the letter is now only occasionally used to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span> denote the long
sound it had originally. This employment of it occurs too mainly in
comparatively recent words of foreign origin. These have brought with
them to a greater or less extent the pronunciation they had in the
tongue from which they came. Some of the most common of these words are
<i>caprice</i> and <i>police</i>; <i>fatigue</i> and <i>intrigue</i>;
<i>profile</i>; <i>machine</i>, <i>magazine</i>, <i>marine</i>, and
<i>routine</i>; and <i>antique</i>, <i>critique</i>, <i>oblique</i>,
and <i>pique</i>. Once too it belonged to <i>oblige</i>, and even to
this day the pronunciation <i>obleege</i> is occasionally heard.</p>

<p>What we call the third vowel is not a vowel, but a diphthong. We can
see its sound and real character indicated in the Roman pronunciation
of <i>Cæsar</i>, the German <i>kaiser</i>, or in the <i>ae</i> of the
Spanish <i>maestro</i>. Against this general movement it can be said
that the long and short sounds of the fourth vowel are much nearer
their originals. This is by no means true, however, of the fifth.
The genuine corresponding long and short sounds of it can be seen
represented in the words <i>fool</i> and <i>full</i>. But we now almost
universally apply the term “short <i>u</i>” to the neutral sound heard
in <i>but</i> and <i>burn</i>. This sound occurs on the most extensive
scale. It has, in fact, come to be one of the most common in our
pronunciation, as to it all the vowels of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span> the unaccented syllables
are disposed to tend. Even the sound of <i>u</i> in accented syllables
begins to show occasional traces of this degeneration. Who has not
heard that provincial pronunciation of the verb <i>put</i> which gives
it the exact value of the initial syllable of <i>putty</i>? With
nothing in our orthography to give fixity to orthoepy, there is little
limit to the possibilities lying before this so-called “short <i>u</i>”
in the way of displacing other sounds.</p>

<p>Let us now summarize the facts of the situation. The primal sound
of the first vowel is on the road to complete disappearance. The
long sound of the second vowel has usurped the name and in part the
proper functions of the first. The long sound of the third vowel has
performed a similar office for the second. The third vowel, so-called,
is a diphthong. On the other hand, the short sounds of these three
vowels—seen in <i>sat</i>, <i>set</i>, <i>sit</i>—continue to exist
in their original integrity. All of them are employed on an extensive
scale. Furthermore, the regular long and short sounds of <i>u</i> have
no longer the prominence they once had in connection with this vowel.
To the popular apprehension the idea of it is supplied, as has just
been said, by the neutral vowel-sound we call “short <i>u</i>.” This
has largely taken the place of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span> other vowel-sounds, and threatens to do
so still more in the future.</p>

<p>The confusion in the use of the vowel-signs is itself reinforced by the
condition of the alphabet. For the former, indeed, the latter is in no
small measure responsible. Behind all the other agencies which have
brought about the present wretched condition of our orthography stands
out its one most glaring defect. The Roman alphabet we have adopted as
our own is unequal to the demand made upon it. The three diphthongs
being included in the consideration, we have at a low calculation
fifteen vowel-sounds and but five characters to represent them.
According to a more common calculation, we have eighteen vowel-sounds
to be represented by this limited number. With the consonants we are
a good deal better off. The supernumeraries being excluded, there are
eighteen single characters for the twenty-four sounds to be denoted.</p>

<p>To make up for this deficiency of letters, two courses lay open to
the users of English; rather, two courses were forced upon them. One
was to have the same sign represent two or more sounds. This was at
best a poor method of relief. Even had it been done correctly and
systematically, so far as that result could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span> accomplished, it could
not have failed to be unsatisfactory. It would have been an attempt to
impose upon these few signs a burden they were unable to carry. But
not even was this imperfect result achieved. Apparently it was not
even aimed at. The sounds of the vowels have been so confused with one
another that no fixed value can be attached to any vowel-sign. They
are often used for each other in the most lawless fashion. So much
is this the case that it is frequently impossible to tell from the
spelling of a word what is the pronunciation of its vowel, or from the
pronunciation of its vowel what is the spelling of the word.</p>

<p>There was another way followed to meet the difficulty. This second
method was to make the best of the situation by that combination
of vowels, or that combination of vowel and consonant, or of two
consonants, to which we have given the name of digraphs. The first
of these do not really constitute diphthongs, though such they have
sometimes been termed. This method was far more sensible than the
preceding. The task of making combinations of letters which should
represent only particular sounds would have been, to be sure, a hard
one. The lawlessness pervading our vowel-system would doubtless
have prevented it from being carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span> out with thoroughness. But
carried out imperfectly, it would have been a distinct improvement
upon what we have now. But so far from any attempt having been made
to accomplish it on even an imperfect scale, it can hardly be said
to have been undertaken at all. There are two instances, indeed, in
which such combinations have an invariable or nearly invariable value.
One of these is <i>aw</i>, found in such words as <i>bawl</i> and
<i>lawn</i>. This digraph never has any other sound than that of the
so-called “broad <i>a</i>”—heard, for illustration, in <i>fall</i>
and <i>salt</i>. The other is <i>ee</i>, seen in <i>seen</i> itself,
as well as in a number of other words. With two or three exceptions,
this combination has that sound of the third vowel we now ascribe to
the second and call “long <i>e</i>.” But in both these instances the
limitation of the digraph to the representation of a single sound
was a result of accident rather than of design. These combinations
were in truth left to run the same haphazard course which the letters
composing them had usually followed. Accordingly, to them extended
the lawlessness pervading the vowel-system. As a consequence, the
pronunciation of the numerous digraphs became, as we shall see later,
as varying and uncertain as that of the single vowels themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>We come now to the consideration of specific details upon which
have been based the general statements just made. Not by any
means all of them. There is no intention here of setting forth an
exhaustive enumeration of the facts that could be presented. Even
did I possess the phonetic knowledge, which I lack, sufficient to
do this properly and fully, the undertaking would have lain outside
of my plan. Furthermore, it would hinder the effect of the argument
for most persons rather than help it. The mass of detail would be
oppressive by its volume, and for that very reason less impressive.
Accordingly, I throw out of consideration any representation of the
variations of pronunciation to be found in unaccented syllables. In
them indistinctness of sound, owing to the inability of our present
orthography to denote precise values, has gone beyond that prevailing
in the other cultivated tongues of modern Europe. Not only are the
vowel-sounds in such syllables pronounced differently by different
individuals, they are pronounced differently by the same individual at
different times. In particular the precise pronunciation will be apt to
vary with the speaker’s rapidity or slowness of utterance. In one case
the exact sound will come out with perfect distinctness, in another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span> it
will be hard to tell by what vowel it is represented. It is enough to
say here of the unaccented syllables that there is a strong tendency,
especially in hasty utterance, to give to them generally the sound of
that neutral vowel we commonly call “short <i>u</i>.”</p>

<p>It is accordingly in these unaccented syllables that so many were
wont to trip in the spelling contests once so popular. It was not
unusual to have the very best equipped contestant fail. He attempted
to use his reason; to succeed, it was essential to discard that
and trust instead to his memory. Take, for illustration, so common
a verb as <i>separate</i>. Who, ignorant of the word, could tell
from the ordinary pronunciation of it—even when that is reasonably
distinct—what is the precise sound heard in the case of the second
syllable? Should it be represented by an <i>a</i> or an <i>e</i>? The
actual fact has to be learned, not through the agency of the ear, but
through that of the eye. This is but a single instance out of hundreds
that could be cited where a similar uncertainty must always prevail
because the pronunciation cannot act as a clear guide to the present
spelling.</p>

<p>In the following pages, therefore, attention shall be directed mainly
to setting forth some of the most salient facts which reveal, in a
way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span> easily comprehensible, the confusion existing in our present
orthography. For this purpose the discussion is intentionally confined
almost entirely to those syllables upon which the principal accent
falls. In a few instances some syllables will be included upon which
rests the secondary accent. In both cases, however, the examples will
be selected of words in which the distinction of sound is plainly
apparent to all, and easily recognizable. This limits the discussion
to but a section of the whole field. But though far from covering
the ground, the absolute truth of the general statements about the
condition of our orthography will appear distinctly manifest to him
who has the patience to wade through the following dreary assemblage
of facts, or perhaps it would be more proper to say, the following
assemblage of dreary facts. Beginning with the vowel-system, the
various letters or combinations of letters will be set forth which are
used to indicate the same sound. In a number of instances these signs
occur on a very small scale. Accordingly, three examples of every one
will be invariably given when the sound heard is represented frequently
by the spelling, or at least more or less frequently. When but one or
two words are specified, this smaller number will denote that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span> these
are all the ordinary ones of that class—exclusive of derivatives and
compounds—which are known to exist. At any rate, they are all that are
known to exist to the writer. It is not unlikely that examples have
been overlooked which will suggest themselves to the reader. We begin
with the vowel-system.</p>


<h3>III<br><span class="small">THE VOWELS</span></h3>

<p>The vowel <i>a</i> demands first attention. The sound of it, heard in
<i>father</i> and <i>far</i>, has been spoken of as disappearing. The
simple vowel usually represents it, so far as it continues to exist.
Other signs, however, are occasionally employed. It is heard in the
<i>ua</i> of <i>guard</i> and <i>guardian</i>, in the <i>ea</i> of
<i>heart</i>, and also of <i>hearken</i> when so spelled; and finally
in England in the <i>e</i> of <i>clerk</i>, <i>sergeant</i>, and a
few other words. Once much more common, it has even there steadily
given way before the advance of the so-called “short <i>u</i>” sound,
occurring in such words as <i>her</i>. In the pronunciation of some
it is further represented, for illustration, by the <i>au</i> of
<i>haunt</i> and <i>haunch</i>. On the other hand, as contrasted
with this declining use, the regular short sound of <i>a</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span> heard
in <i>man</i> and <i>mat</i>, is preserved in its fullest vigor.
In the large majority of instances it is indicated by the simple
letter itself. The exceptions to this representation of it are merely
sporadic. Such are the <i>ua</i> of <i>guarantee</i> and the <i>ai</i>
of <i>plaid</i>.</p>

<p>But dismissing the consideration of these two sounds of this vowel,
take those heard respectively in the words <i>fare</i>, <i>fall</i>,
and <i>fate</i>. Let us begin with the first of these. Its sound
is denoted in many words by the simple vowel, as can be seen in
<i>pare</i>, <i>care</i>, <i>declare</i>. But it is also indicated
by <i>ai</i> in <i>pair</i>, <i>hair</i>, <i>stair</i>; by <i>ay</i>
in <i>prayer</i>; by <i>e</i> in <i>there</i> and <i>where</i>; and
by <i>ei</i> in <i>their</i> and <i>heir</i>. The second of these is
the <i>au</i> sound heard in <i>all</i>, <i>warm</i>, <i>want</i>. It
is not unfrequently denominated “broad <i>a</i>.” But besides this
vowel the sound is further represented by <i>o</i> in such words as
<i>oft</i>, <i>loss</i>, <i>song</i>; by <i>au</i> in <i>daub</i>,
<i>haul</i>, <i>taught</i>, and the like; similarly by <i>aw</i>
in <i>saw</i>, <i>drawn</i>, <i>bawl</i>, and numerous others;
by <i>oa</i> in <i>broad</i>; and by <i>ou</i> in <i>sought</i>,
<i>thought</i>, <i>bought</i>.</p>

<p>It has already been pointed out that the so-called long sound of
<i>a</i> does not strictly belong to it; that it is really an <i>e</i>
sound. But as it has imposed its name upon the vowel, it is properly
to be considered with it in any treatise which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span> appeals to the general
public. Its most usual representative is the letter itself, seen in
<i>pale</i>, <i>pane</i>, <i>page</i>, and in scores of words in which
the presence of an unpronounced final <i>e</i> has come to indicate
generally, though not invariably, that the preceding vowel is long. But
then again it is represented by <i>ai</i> in <i>pail</i>, <i>pain</i>,
<i>exclaim</i>; by <i>ay</i> in <i>lay</i>, <i>pay</i>, <i>day</i>; by
<i>ea</i> in <i>great</i>, <i>steak</i>, <i>break</i>; by <i>ei</i>
in <i>veil</i>, <i>vein</i>, <i>heinous</i>; and by <i>ey</i> in
<i>they</i>, <i>obey</i> and <i>survey</i>. In the interjection
<i>eh</i> the vowel has for once its original sound. Again there are
two instances in which a digraph with this sound occurs in but a
single case. These two are the <i>ao</i> of <i>gaol</i> and the au of
<i>gauge</i>.</p>

<p>In the case of the first of these words there were two ways of spelling
it which existed from the fourteenth century. These are <i>gaol</i> and
<i>jail</i>. The first form comes from the dialect of Normandy, the
second from that of Paris. Both have been in use from the beginning.
About both there has been to some extent controversy, at least in the
past. The New Historical Dictionary, which contains a full history of
the origin and use of these two forms, gives us a quotation bearing
upon this point from Roger L’Estrange’s translation of the <i>Visions
of Quevedo</i>. In this version, which appeared in 1668, English
allusions were not unfrequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span> introduced. In one instance men are
represented as being in a state of rage because they cannot come to a
resolution as to whether they ought to say <i>Goal</i> (<i>sic</i>)
or <i>Jayl</i>. <i>Gaol</i> is still the official form of the word
in England. That fact has mainly contributed to its maintenance in
literature, so far as it continues to be used. In the United States
<i>jail</i> is both the official and the literary form. But the
spelling <i>gaol</i> has to some a peculiar attraction of its own. Not
a single letter in it save the final <i>l</i> is of use in indicating
with certainty its right pronunciation. In truth, the orthography
almost enforces a wrong one. There are those to whom this fact is the
highest recommendation it can have.</p>

<p>The second word has varied between the spellings <i>gauge</i> and
<i>gage</i> almost from its very entrance into the language in the
fifteenth century. One gets the impression that there was a time when
the latter was the preferred form. But with our present knowledge
no statement of this sort can be made positively. “You shall not
gage me by what we do to-night,” says Gratiano to Bassanio in <i>The
Merchant of Venice</i>. Modern editions, in defiance of the original,
print <i>gauge</i>; for the folio and both the early quartos agree
in having <i>gage</i>. Shakespeare’s use seems to be nothing but
another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span> illustration of his perverse preference for the so-called
American spelling, or the American preference for Shakespeare’s
spelling, just as one chooses to put it. Such an anomalous form
as <i>gauge</i> proved at times too much for the tolerance of the
orthographically much-enduring Englishman. Even him it has struck as
peculiarly objectionable. So in the eighteenth century he set out to
remove this particular blot upon the speech. But as he was in nowise
tainted with the virus of reform, he exhibited the usual incurable
aversion to having the spelling bear any relation to the pronunciation.
Accordingly, he refused to take the natural as well as time-honored
course of dropping the unnecessary and misleading <i>u</i>. Instead, he
reversed the order of the letters of the digraph. The <i>au</i> became
<i>ua</i>.</p>

<p>There have been in modern times men who advocated this method of
spelling the word with all that fervor of faith which is so frequent
an accompaniment of limited knowledge. On this point, for instance,
the late Grant Allen felt called upon to bear his testimony. He was
wont to make his novels a vehicle for conveying his linguistic views
as well as those pertaining to religion, society, and politics.
“Cynicus replied, with an ugly smile,” he wrote, “that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span> nobody could
ever guage anybody else’s nature.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Then, with what might fairly be
called an ugly smile of his own, Allen added in a parenthesis, “not
<i>gauge</i>, a vile dictionary blunder.” There was no apparent reason
for this lexical outburst; there was certainly no proof vouchsafed of
the justice of the assertion. As the originals of the word were the Old
French noun <i>gauge</i> and the verb <i>gauger</i>, it is hard to see
how dictionaries could be held responsible for blunders, if blunders
they were, which foreigners had perpetrated centuries before. There
is, in truth, as little etymological justification for <i>guage</i> as
there is phonetic for <i>gauge</i>. <i>Gage</i>, if it were not the
most common way of spelling the word during the Elizabethan period, was
certainly a common one. It is now, on the whole, the preferred form in
the United States. Except in the nautical term <i>weather-gage</i>,
the u is very generally retained in England. This is doubtless due to
the desire of gratifying the ardent enthusiasm pervading the toiling
millions of Great Britain for spellings which remind them of the Old
French originals, from which were derived the words they employ.</p>

<p>In the case of the second vowel, the short <i>e</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span> sound is properly
shown in a large number of words of which <i>let</i>, <i>felt</i>,
<i>bed</i> may be taken as representatives. These are all phonetically
spelled. No educated man who saw them for the first time would have any
hesitation about their pronunciation. Such a condition of things tends
to chasten the feelings of that class of persons, not inconsiderable
in number, who think it distinctively to the credit of the spelling
that it should get as far away from the pronunciation as possible.
They may be consoled, however, by the fact that this same sound is
represented by <i>a</i> in <i>any</i> and <i>many</i>; by <i>ea</i>
in a large number of words, such as <i>health</i>, <i>endeavor</i>,
<i>weather</i>; by ai in <i>said</i> and <i>again</i>; by <i>ay</i>
in says; by <i>ei</i> in <i>heifer</i> and <i>nonpareil</i>, and
by <i>eo</i> in <i>jeopard</i> and <i>leopard</i>. There are those
who give this short sound to <i>leisure</i>, rhyming it with
<i>pleasure</i>, as did Milton,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> instead of the more common long
sound heard with us. Indeed, it is noticeable that preference is
given to the former in the New Historical English Dictionary, though
that pronunciation is absolutely ignored in some of the best American
ones. The compilers of these last may have been touched by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span> Walker’s
pathetic plea for the long sound. “<i>Leisure</i>,” he wrote, “is
sometimes pronounced as rhyming with <i>pleasure</i>; but in my opinion
very improperly; for if it be allowed that custom is equally divided,
we ought, in this case, to pronounce the diphthong long, as more
expressive of the idea annexed to it.”</p>

<p><i>Any</i> and <i>many</i> are now the only two words where <i>a</i>
has the sound of short <i>e</i>. At one time it was heard in others,
and was not unfrequently so represented in literature. It lingers,
too, in some instances, and even, indeed, flourishes in spite of all
the efforts of education to extirpate it. The present authorized
pronunciation of <i>catch</i>, instead of <i>ketch</i>, is one of
the comparatively few triumphs gained by the written word over the
spoken. In days when devotion did not exist to orthography irrespective
of the purpose it was designed to fulfil, the <i>a</i> assumed the
spelling of <i>e</i> along with its sound. The earlier <i>cag</i>,
for illustration, has been abandoned for the pure phonetic spelling
<i>keg</i>. Apparently no serious harm has befallen the language
in consequence. Even more distant from the remote Latin original,
<i>canalis</i>, denoting the home of <i>canis</i>, ‘the dog,’ is
the form <i>kennel</i>. This turns its back upon its primitive, and
contents itself with simply representing the pronunciation. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span> much
are we the creatures of habit and association in the matter of spelling
that the most ardent believer in the doctrine of basing orthography
upon derivation could in neither of the cases just mentioned be
persuaded to revert to the form nearest to that in the original tongue.</p>

<p>The sound to which we give the name of “long <i>e</i>” belongs
strictly, as has been pointed out, to <i>i</i>. A few of the words have
also been given in which it still continues to be so indicated.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
There are certain conditions under which it is represented by the
simple letter itself. One is when it alone constitutes an accented
syllable, as in <i>equal</i>, <i>era</i>, <i>ecliptic</i>. Another
when it ends a monosyllable or an accented syllable, as in <i>he</i>,
<i>be</i>, <i>regal</i>, <i>cohesion</i>. It appears finally with a
good deal of frequency in words in which the sound of the simple vowel
is lengthened by the artificial device of an appended mute <i>e</i>,
as in <i>theme</i>, <i>precede</i>, <i>complete</i>. This last word,
it may be said in passing, was once often spelled <i>compleat</i>. But
as the letter itself represents much more usually the short sound of
the vowel, the long sound has come to be indicated often by various
digraphs. Of these, two are particularly prominent. One of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span> them is
<i>ee</i>, seen in a large number of words, such as <i>meet</i>,
<i>thee</i>, <i>proceed</i>. The second digraph is <i>ea</i>, found in
<i>bean</i>, <i>meat</i>, <i>eagle</i>, and a host of others. But the
sound is not limited to these two combinations. It is represented by
<i>ei</i> in <i>receive</i>, <i>conceit</i>, <i>seize</i>; by <i>ie</i>
in <i>believe</i>, <i>chief</i>, <i>fiend</i>; by <i>ey</i> in
<i>key</i>; by <i>eo</i> in <i>people</i>; by <i>ay</i> in <i>quay</i>;
by <i>æ</i> in <i>ægis</i>, <i>pæan</i>, <i>minutiæ</i>; and several
other words not fully naturalized.</p>

<p>Once, indeed, this last method of indicating the sound was far more
common. In many instances it has been supplanted by the simple
<i>e</i>. It was not till a comparatively late period that such
spellings as <i>era</i> and <i>ether</i> drove out in great measure
the once prevalent <i>æra</i> and <i>æther</i>. As <i>æ</i> has
with us strictly but one sound, the change cannot, from all points
of view, be deemed an improvement. In the case of an unknown word
first brought to the attention, no one could now be positive, under
certain conditions, whether the vowel should be treated as long
or short. Take, for illustration, <i>encyclopedia</i>, once often
spelled <i>encyclopædia</i>. He who sees the word for the first time
is as likely to pronounce the antepenultimate syllable <i>pĕd</i> as
<i>pēd</i>. He certainly could not tell from the orthography employed
how this particular syllable should be sounded. Still, for much more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
than a century the tendency of the users of the language has been
steadily directed toward the discarding of the <i>æ</i> in all cases.
As long ago as 1755 Dr. Johnson, in his dictionary, recommended its
disuse. “<i>Æ</i>,” he wrote, “is sometimes found in Latin words not
completely naturalized or assimilated, but is by no means an English
diphthong, and is more properly expressed by single <i>e</i>, as
<i>Cesar</i>, <i>Eneas</i>.” Dr. Johnson was hostile to spelling
reform; but he could venture to sanction a spelling of these two Latin
proper names, at which even the average spelling reformer would shudder.</p>

<p>Fortunately for those of us who believe that spelling exists for the
sake of indicating pronunciation, the sound of short <i>i</i>, one
of the most common vowel sounds in the language, is almost always
represented by the letter itself. The exceptions are few, comparatively
speaking. The only sign to take its place in any body of words
sufficiently numerous to be entitled a class is <i>y</i>, as seen in
<i>syntax</i>, <i>abyss</i>, <i>system</i>, and other words, generally
of Greek origin. The instances where different signs are employed
are purely sporadic. Most of them, however, are for various reasons
remarkable. The sound is represented by <i>e</i> in the name of the
language we speak and of the country where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span> it came into being. It is
further represented by the <i>e</i> of <i>pretty</i>, by the <i>o</i>
of <i>women</i>, by the <i>u</i> of <i>busy</i> and <i>business</i>,
by the <i>ie</i> of <i>sieve</i>, and by the <i>ui</i> of <i>guild</i>
and <i>guilt</i> and <i>build</i>. Once in the speech of most men, and
now in that of many, it is given to the <i>ee</i> of <i>been</i>, and
regularly to that combination as found in <i>breeches</i>.</p>

<p><i>Gild</i> is a variant spelling of <i>guild</i>, and represents
the earlier form. The <i>ui</i> of the two additional examples given
ought to be a saddening spectacle to the devout believer in derivation
as the basis of orthography. The original form of <i>guilt</i>
was <i>gylt</i>. So it remained with various spellings—of which
<i>gilt</i> was naturally the most common—until the sixteenth century.
But there was also an allied form, <i>gult</i>. These two undoubtedly
represented distinct and easily recognizable pronunciations of the
word. They were at last combined so as to create a spelling, of the
pronunciation of which no one could now be certain until he was
told. This did not take place on any scale worth mentioning until
the latter part of the sixteenth century, though the combination had
occasionally been seen much earlier. Essentially the same thing can be
said of <i>build</i>. It originally appeared in various ways, of which
<i>byld</i>, <i>bild</i>, and <i>buld</i> were the prominent types. At
the end of the fifteenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span> century the practice began of recognizing
both forms by writing <i>build</i> or <i>buyld</i>. In a measure this
doubtless represented a then existing shade of pronunciation. The
spelling, once established, has continued since. No one ever thinks of
pronouncing the <i>u</i>; perhaps no one has ever thought of it since
the combination was formed. Yet there is no question that intense
sorrow would be occasioned to a certain class of persons were they to
be deprived of the pleasure of inserting in the word this useless and
now orthoepically misleading letter.</p>

<p>The so-called “long <i>i</i>” ought strictly to be treated under the
diphthongs; but as it is popularly associated in the minds of men
with the simple vowel, its diphthongal sound will be considered at
this point. Its most usual representative is the letter itself. This
presents little difficulty in the pronunciation if the words end with
a mute <i>e</i>, as in <i>mine</i>, <i>desire</i>, <i>bite</i>. The
distinction between <i>thin</i> and <i>thine</i>, for instance, is
then easily made. But when it comes to such words as <i>mind</i>,
<i>child</i>, and <i>pint</i> on the one hand, and <i>lift</i>,
<i>gild</i>, and <i>tint</i> on the other, there is nothing in
the spelling to indicate with certainty how the <i>i</i> of these
words should be sounded. As no general rule can be laid down, the
pronunciation of each has in consequence to be learned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span> by itself. This
uncertainty was perhaps one of the causes which led to the transition
of the diphthongal sound of <i>i</i> in <i>wind</i> to the short sound
<i>wĭnd</i>, which so aroused the wrath of Dean Swift. But besides
<i>i</i> the sound is also indicated by the <i>y</i> of <i>type</i>,
<i>ally</i>, <i>thyme</i>, and a number of words derived from the
Greek; by <i>ie</i>, especially in monosyllables, such as <i>die</i>,
<i>lie</i>, and <i>tie</i>; by <i>ye</i> in the noun <i>lye</i>; by
<i>ei</i> in <i>height</i> and <i>sleight</i>, and according to one
method of pronunciation in <i>either</i> and <i>neither</i>. It is
further represented by the <i>ai</i> of <i>aisle</i>, by the <i>ey</i>
of <i>eye</i>, and by the <i>uy</i> of <i>buy</i>.</p>

<p>The third vowel now demands attention. Orthoepists contend that there
is no genuine short <i>o</i> in English utterance. Without entering
into a discussion of this point, it is sufficient to say that the
two sounds of the letter, which are ordinarily designated as short
and long, are represented respectively in the words <i>not</i> and
<i>note</i>. The former sound remains fairly faithful to this vowel.
It is hardly indicated by any other sign. The <i>a</i> of <i>what</i>,
<i>squad</i>, <i>quarry</i> is about the only one to take its place.
Very different is it with the long sound heard in <i>note</i>. This is
far from confining itself to any single letter. In no small number of
words it is represented by <i>oa</i>, as in <i>boat</i>, <i>groan</i>,
<i>coal</i>; by <i>oe</i>, as in <i>foe</i>, <i>toe</i>, <i>hoe</i>;
by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span> <i>ou</i>, as in <i>pour</i>, <i>mould</i>, <i>shoulder</i>; or
again by <i>ow</i>, as seen in <i>crow</i>, <i>snow</i>, <i>show</i>.
Less common, but still to be met with, is this sound heard in the
combination <i>ew</i>, as seen in <i>sew</i>; as well as in <i>shew</i>
and <i>strew</i>, as these words were once regularly and are now
occasionally spelled; in <i>oo</i>, as in <i>door</i> and <i>floor</i>;
in <i>eau</i>, in <i>beau</i>, <i>bureau</i>, and <i>flambeau</i>; and
in the <i>eo</i> of <i>yeoman</i>.</p>

<p>This last word was once spelled at times <i>yoman</i> and at times
<i>yeman</i>. These forms doubtless represented the two ways of
pronouncing it that existed. The <i>Toxophilus</i> of Roger Ascham,
for illustration, was dedicated to the use “of the gentlemen and yomen
of Englande.” But the sound of the vowel of the first syllable wavered
for a long period between the long <i>o</i> and the short <i>e</i>. Ben
Jonson, in the earlier part of the seventeenth century, observed of
the word that “it were truer written <i>yĕman</i>.” In the latter half
of the eighteenth century Doctor Johnson tells us that the <i>eo</i>
of this word “is sounded like <i>e</i> short.” This was the view taken
by perhaps the larger number of orthoepists, who immediately followed
him. In spite of them the <i>o</i> pronunciation has triumphed. It
has shown, however, a tender consideration for its defeated rival by
allowing it to lead a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span> useless existence in the syllable in which, in
the utterance of many, it once represented the actual sound.</p>

<p>The corresponding short and long sounds of <i>u</i> are seen in the
words <i>full</i> and <i>rule</i>. But <i>o</i>, either singly, or
in combination with other letters, is a favorite way of indicating
both. The short sound of this vowel, which is far from common, is
represented by the <i>o</i> of <i>bosom</i>, <i>woman</i>, <i>wolf</i>;
by the <i>oo</i> of <i>good</i>, <i>foot</i>, <i>stood</i>; by the
<i>ou</i> of <i>could</i>, <i>would</i>, <i>should</i>. On the
other hand, the corresponding long sound is also represented by the
<i>o</i> of <i>move</i>, <i>prove</i>, <i>lose</i>; by the <i>oe</i>
of <i>shoe</i> and <i>canoe</i>; by the <i>oo</i> of <i>too</i>,
<i>root</i>, <i>fool</i>; by <i>ou</i> in such words as <i>uncouth</i>,
<i>routine</i>, <i>youth</i>, and a number of others derived generally
from the French. There has been and still is something of a tendency
on the part of the users of language to change the long sound of
<i>oo</i> into its short one. Oliver Wendell Holmes, in his poem of
<i>Urania</i>, represents Learning as giving a lesson on propriety of
pronunciation. Among other points considered, occurred the following
observations:</p>

<p class="poetry">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She pardoned one, our classic city’s boast,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That said at Cambridge mŏst instead of mōst,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But knit her brows and stamped her angry foot</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To hear a Teacher call a rōot a rŏot.</span><br>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>This is perhaps as good an example as can be furnished of the waste
of time and labor imposed by our present orthography in mastering
distinctions of sounds in words when there is nothing in the sign
employed to indicate which one is proper. To men not given up to
slavish admiration of our present spelling, it would seem that
Learning, instead of stamping her foot, would have been much more
sensibly engaged in using her head to devise some method by which
one and the same combination of letters should not be called upon to
represent two distinct sounds in words so closely allied in form as
<i>foot</i> and <i>root</i>; or distinct sounds in words with the same
ending as <i>toe</i> and the <i>shoe</i> that covers it.</p>

<p>Another way of indicating the long sound of this vowel is either
by the simple letter itself or by it in combination with other
letters. For instance, it is represented by <i>ue</i> in such
words as <i>true</i>, <i>avenue</i>, <i>pursue</i>; by <i>ui</i>
in <i>fruit</i>, <i>bruise</i>, <i>pursuit</i>; by <i>eu</i> in
<i>neuter</i>, <i>deuce</i>, <i>pentateuch</i>; by <i>ew</i> in
<i>brew</i>, <i>sewer</i>, <i>lewd</i>; and by <i>ieu</i> in
<i>adieu</i>, <i>lieu</i>, <i>purlieu</i>. But there is a peculiarity
in the words containing this vowel, the consideration of which
involves too much space to have little more than a reference here.
We all recognize the difference of the sound of <i>u</i> as heard
respectively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span> in <i>fortune</i> and <i>fortuitous</i>, in <i>annual</i>
and <i>annuity</i>, in <i>volume</i> and <i>voluminous</i>, in
<i>penury</i> and <i>penurious</i>. In the first one of each of
these pairs of words a <i>y</i>-element is introduced into the
pronunciation; in the second the <i>u</i> has its absolutely pure
long sound. Nor is this introduction of the <i>y</i>-element limited
to the letter when used alone. We can find it exemplified in the
<i>ue</i> of <i>statue</i>, <i>value</i>, <i>tissue</i>; in the
<i>eu</i> of <i>eulogy</i>, <i>euphony</i>, <i>Europe</i>; in the
<i>ew</i> of <i>ewe</i>, <i>hew</i>, <i>few</i>. This iotization, as
it is called, is especially prevalent in words with the termination
<i>ture</i>, as <i>nature</i>, <i>furniture</i>, <i>sculpture</i>,
and <i>agriculture</i>. Now and then some one is heard giving, or
attempting to give, to the <i>u</i> of this ending the pure sound; but
such persons are usually regarded as possessed of “cultoor” and not
culture.</p>

<p>The only word of this special class in which such a method of
pronunciation can be said to have attained any recognition whatever
is <i>literature</i>. The word itself is an old one in our speech.
Once, however, it meant merely knowledge of literature. It did not
mean that body of writings which constitute the production of a
country or of a period. This sense of it, now the most common, is
comparatively modern. The earliest instance I have chanced to meet
of it—though it was doubtless used a good deal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span> earlier—is in the
correspondence of Southey and William Taylor of Norwich. There it
occurs in a letter belonging to the year 1803, in which Southey tells
his friend that he was expecting to undertake the editorship of a work
dealing biographically and critically with “the history of English
literature.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Still, the pronunciation just mentioned of this word,
differing as it does from the others of the same class, must even then
have been occasionally heard. It was certainly made the subject of
comment by Byron. He somewhere speaks—I have mislaid the reference—of
a publisher who was in the habit of talking about <i>literatoor</i>.
This peculiar pronunciation still comes at times from the lips of
educated men.</p>

<p>But the regular long and short sounds of <i>u</i> yield in frequency of
occurrence to that sound of it heard in <i>but</i> and <i>burn</i>. In
common speech this has usurped with us the title of “short <i>u</i>.”
By orthoepists it itself is divided into a long and a short sound,
according as it is or is not followed by an <i>r</i>. Into it, as has
been pointed out, the pronunciation of all unaccented syllables tends
to run. Hence, in the case of these,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span> there has come to exist the
greatest possible variety of signs by which it is indicated. But even
in the accented syllables there is a sufficient number of different
ones to arrest the attention. Naturally the most usual representative
of it is the vowel from which it has taken its name. But it is far from
being limited to this sign. Its short sound is further represented by
the <i>o</i> of such words as <i>love</i>, <i>dove</i>, and <i>son</i>;
similarly by the <i>ou</i> of <i>double</i>, <i>touch</i>, and
<i>young</i>; and by the <i>oo</i> of <i>blood</i> and <i>flood</i>.
In vulgar speech <i>soot</i> would have to be added to the last two.
Furthermore, it is represented by the sporadic example of the <i>oe</i>
of <i>does</i>. The long sound runs through a still wider range of
examples. Words containing it but denoted by various signs could
be given by the score. It is represented by all the vowels except
the first. The <i>e</i> of <i>her</i>, <i>were</i>, <i>fern</i>,
stands for it. So does the <i>i</i> of <i>fir</i>, <i>bird</i>,
<i>virgin</i>. So does the <i>o</i> of <i>work</i>, <i>worship</i>,
<i>worth</i>. It is likewise largely represented by <i>ea</i> in such
words as <i>heard</i>, <i>learn</i>, <i>search</i>; by <i>ou</i> in
<i>scourge</i>, <i>journal</i>, <i>flourish</i>, and no small number
of others containing this particular sign. In the single instance of
<i>tierce</i> the sound is denoted also by <i>ie</i>. Were its use in
unaccented syllables indicated, this list of signs would be largely
extended. As it is, it will be seen that nine is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span> number employed
in accented syllables to represent it.</p>

<p>So much for the simple vowels. We come now to the three diphthongs.
The first of these, which is made up of the sound of the <i>a</i>
of <i>father</i> and that of the <i>e</i> of <i>they</i>, has
already been considered in treating what is called “long <i>i</i>.”
Eight signs were given by which it was denoted.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> This wealth of
representation does not belong to the two other diphthongs. There are
but two signs by which the sound of the second is indicated. These
are the <i>ou</i> of <i>south</i>, <i>found</i>, <i>about</i>, and
the <i>ow</i> of <i>now</i>, <i>town</i>, <i>vowel</i>. The third
diphthong again has but two signs, the <i>oi</i> of <i>boil</i>,
<i>point</i>, <i>spoil</i>, and the <i>oy</i> of <i>boy</i>,
<i>joy</i>, <i>destroy</i>. Many of the words in which <i>oi</i>
appears had once the pronunciation of the first mentioned diphthong.
To the truth of this both the rymes of the poets and the assertions
of the early orthoepists bear ample testimony. The statement is
still further confirmed by the fact that the sound still lingers,
or, rather, is prevalent, in the speech of the uneducated, the great
conservators of past usage. The words given above as illustrative of
this sign of the diphthong would have been pronounced by our fathers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
<i>bīle</i>, <i>pīnt</i>, <i>spīle</i>. So they are still pronounced
by the illiterate. In one word, indeed, this sound has not passed
entirely from the colloquial speech of the cultivated either in England
or America. <i>Roil</i> is not merely heard as <i>rīle</i>, but is not
unfrequently found so printed.</p>


<h3>IV<br><span class="small">THE DIGRAPHS</span></h3>

<p>Up to this point we have been engaged in making manifest the numerous
different ways in which the same vowel-sound is represented in our
present orthography. Necessarily a reversal of the process would
present an equally impressive showing, for examples just as impressive
would make manifest how the same sign adds to the further confusion
of English spelling by denoting a number of different vowel-sounds.
But there is a limit to the endurance of the reader, to say nothing of
that of the writer. Furthermore, there is little need of this addition
in the case of the vowels. The facts about to be furnished will be
more than sufficient to satisfy any demand for illustrations of the
extent to which the same sign has been made to indicate a wide variety
of different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span> sounds, though in the sporadic instances the examples
already given must be repeated. For we come now to the consideration
of those combinations of letters, numerous in English spelling, to
which has been given the name of digraphs. They are sometimes made up
of a union of vowels, sometimes of a union of a vowel and a consonant,
sometimes of a union of two consonants.</p>

<p>I have already adverted to the fact that had there been any system
established in the employment of these combinations of letters, and
had each of them been made to represent unvaryingly one particular
sound, some of the worst evils of English orthography would have been
largely mitigated, and in certain cases entirely relieved. But this
was not to be. The opportunity of bringing about regularity of usage
in the employment of these signs was either not seen, or if seen was
not improved. The same variableness, the same irregularity, the same
lawlessness which existed in the representation of the sounds of the
vowels and diphthongs came to exist in the case of the digraphs also.
They consequently did little more than add to the confusion prevailing
in English orthography, and became as valueless for indicating
pronunciation as are the single letters of which they are composed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>To this sweeping statement there are two partial exceptions. The first
is <i>aw</i>. This is one of several representatives of the so-called
broad sound of <i>a</i> heard in <i>ball</i> and <i>fall</i>. Whenever
that digraph appears, its pronunciation is invariably the same. No such
absolute assertion can be made of the digraph which represents the
sound of “long <i>e</i>.” This is the combination <i>ee</i>. There are
but two exceptions in common use to the pronunciation of it just given.
The first is the word <i>breeches</i>. Its singular has the regular
sound. The pronunciation as short <i>i</i> in the plural—used, too,
there in a special sense—may perhaps be due to an extension to this
form of that tendency, so prevalent in English speech, on the part
of the derivative, to shorten the vowel of the primitive. The other
is the participle <i>been</i> of the substantive verb. In usage the
pronunciation of this word has long wavered and still wavers between
the sounds heard respectively in <i>sin</i> and <i>seen</i>. Of this
variation there will be occasion to speak later in detail.</p>

<p>These exceptions, however, affect but a limited number of words. They
are hardly worth considering when their regularity is put in contrast
with the irregularities of the other combinations. Let us begin with
the digraph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span> <i>ai</i>. Ordinarily it has the sound we are accustomed
to call “long a,” as can be seen in <i>fail</i>, <i>rain</i>, and
<i>paid</i>. In <i>pair</i>, <i>fair</i>, <i>hair</i> it has another
sound. In <i>said</i>, <i>again</i>, <i>against</i> it has the sound
of short <i>e</i>. In <i>aisle</i> it has the diphthongal sound called
by us “long <i>i</i>.” This word furnishes an interesting illustration
of the way in which much of our highly prized orthography came to have
a being. Its present spelling is comparatively recent. Doctor Johnson
recognized in it the lack of conformity to any possible derivation. He
adopted it on the authority of Addison, though with manifest misgiving.
He thought it ought to be written <i>aile</i>, but in deference to this
author he inserted it in his dictionary as <i>aisle</i>.</p>

<p>“Thus,” he said, “the word is written by Addison, but perhaps
improperly.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Johnson’s action was followed without thought and
without hesitation by his successors. There is no question, indeed,
as to the impropriety of the present spelling from the point of view
of both derivation and pronunciation. Equally there is no doubt as to
the impropriety of its meaning from the former point of view. It came
remotely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span> from the Latin <i>ala</i>, ‘a wing.’ Therefore, it means
really the wing part of the church on each side of the nave. In this
sense it is still employed. But since the first half of the eighteenth
century it has been made to denote also the passage between rows of
seats. Strictly speaking, this is a particularly gross corruption,
though, like so many in our speech, it has now been sanctioned by good
usage. The proper word to indicate such a sense was <i>alley</i>,
corresponding to the French <i>allée</i>, ‘a passage.’ This was
once common and is still used in the North of England. <i>Aisle</i>
itself was formerly spelled <i>ile</i> or <i>yle</i>. Confusing it
with <i>isle</i>, originally spelled <i>ile</i>, men inserted an
<i>s</i> about the end of the seventeenth century. Later an <i>a</i>
was prefixed under the influence of the French <i>aile</i>. It was
thus that this linguistic monster, defying any correct orthography
or orthoepy, was created. In any sense of it the <i>s</i> is an
unjustifiable intrusion, representing as the word does in one
signification the Latin <i>ala</i>, ‘a wing,’ and in the other the
French <i>allée</i>, ‘a passage.’</p>

<p>There is another word containing this digraph which illustrates vividly
the uncertainty of sound caused by the present spelling. This is
<i>plait</i>, both as verb and substantive. About its pronunciation
usage has long been conflicting.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span> “<i>Plait</i>, a fold of cloth,
is regular, and ought to be pronounced like <i>plate</i>, a dish,”
said Walker, at the beginning of the eighteenth century. “Pronouncing
it so as to rhyme with <i>meat</i>,” he added, “is a vulgarism, and
ought to be avoided.” So say several later English dictionaries.
So say the leading American ones. Webster, indeed, concedes that
the pronunciation denounced by Walker is colloquially possible. It
therefore does not necessarily relegate the user of it to the ranks
of the vulgar. Now comes the New Historical English Dictionary, and
gives the word not merely three distinct pronunciations, but holds up
as only really proper that which has failed to gain the favor of most
lexicographers. It is the one found “in living English use,” it says,
when the word has the sense of ‘fold.’ Further we are assured that with
this signification it is ordinarily written <i>pleat</i>. This would
tend to justify still more the ryme with <i>meat</i>, which so shocked
Walker. Then in its second sense of a ‘braid of hair or straw’ we are
told that it has the sound of <i>a</i> in <i>mat</i>. This leaves the
pronunciation of <i>plait</i> to ryme with <i>plate</i> hardly any
support to stand on. It has merely the distinction of being mentioned
first; but it is denied a real existence as a spoken word. Nothing
could better illustrate the unlimited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span> possibilities opened by our
present orthography for discussions of propriety of pronunciation about
which certainty can never be assured. All statements about general
usage, no matter from what source coming, must necessarily be received
with a good many grains of allowance, if not with a fair proportion of
grains of distrust—at least, whenever our orthoepic doctors disagree.
Do the best the most conscientious investigator can, he can never make
himself familiar with the practice of but a limited number of educated
men who have a right to be consulted. His conclusions, therefore, must
always rest upon a more or less imperfect collection of facts.</p>

<p>The digraph <i>ay</i> is naturally subject to the same influences as
<i>ai</i>. It is, however, much less used save at the end of words.
Grief has, indeed, been felt and expressed, even by devout worshippers
of our present orthography, at the arbitrary change of signs made
in the inflection of certain verbs, like <i>lay</i>, <i>pay</i>,
<i>say</i>. These, without any apparent reason for so doing, pass from
the digraph <i>ay</i> in the present to <i>ai</i> in the preterite.
Naturally there is no objectionable uniformity in the practice. That
might tend to render slightly easier the acquisition of our spelling.
Accordingly, <i>lay</i> and <i>pay</i> and <i>say</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span> have in the
past tense <i>laid</i>, <i>paid</i>, and <i>said</i>, while verbs with
the same termination, such as <i>play</i>, <i>pray</i>, <i>delay</i>,
have in this same past tense the forms <i>played</i> and <i>prayed</i>
and <i>delayed</i>. <i>Stay</i> uses impartially <i>staid</i> and
<i>stayed</i>. Much dissatisfaction has been expressed at the “wanton
departure from analogy,” as it has been called, which has been
manifested by the words of the first list given. As the characteristic
of our spelling everywhere is a wanton departure from analogy, it
hardly seems worth while to find fault with this particular exhibition
of it.</p>

<p>In <i>quay</i> the digraph has the entirely distinct sound of
“long <i>e</i>.” Of this word it may be added that the spelling is
modern while the pronunciation is ancient. Originally it appeared
as <i>key</i> or <i>kay</i>—of course, with the usual orthographic
variations. In the earlier half of the eighteenth century, under the
influence of the French <i>quai</i>, the present form of the word
came in; toward the end of the century it had become the prevailing
form. This gave the lexicographer, Walker, an opportunity to display
his hostility to any sort of spelling which should engage in the
reprehensible task of aiming to indicate pronunciation. Such a
proceeding was in his eyes a radically vicious course of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span> action. In
the entire ignorance of the original form of the word he remarked
that it “is now sometimes seen written <i>key</i>; for if we cannot
bring the pronunciation to the spelling, it is looked upon as some
improvement to bring the spelling to the pronunciation—a most
pernicious practice in language.”</p>

<p><i>Key</i>, as the spelling suggests, had originally the sound of
<i>ey</i> in <i>they</i> and <i>obey</i>; later it passed into the
sound of “long <i>e</i>.” This it has transmitted to its supplanter. In
the scarcity of rymes in our tongue, it is always a little venturesome
to infer from the evidence of verse the past pronunciation of words
which have with us the same termination, but different sounds. This
imparts a little uncertainty to the treatment of <i>quay</i> in two
passages containing the word which are given by the New Historical
Dictionary.</p>

<p class="poetry">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But now arrives the dismal day</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She must return to Ormond-quay,</span><br>
</p>

<p class="p0">says Swift in his poem of <i>Stella at Wood-Park</i>. Does the ryme
here represent an attempt to conform the pronunciation to the spelling?
More likely it represents the survival of a pronunciation once more or
less prevalent. The second extract from <i>In Memoriam</i> is under the
circumstances more striking:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p class="poetry">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If one should bring me the report</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That thou hadst touched the land to-day,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And I went down unto the quay,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And found thee lying in the port.</span><br>
</p>

<p>It certainly looks as if in this passage Tennyson had set out to make
the pronunciation conform to the spelling.</p>

<p>Our next digraph is <i>ea</i>. This has a choice variety of sounds
to represent. Most commonly it receives the pronunciation of “long
<i>e</i>.” Of the scores of examples containing it, <i>beast</i>,
<i>hear</i>, and <i>deal</i> may be taken as specimens. But while
this is its most frequent sound, it is far from being the only one.
Its most important rival is that of short <i>e</i>, which can be
found in no small number of words like <i>breath</i>, <i>breast</i>,
<i>weather</i>. In these and all other like cases the second vowel is
absolutely superfluous as regards pronunciation. The unnecessary letter
is in some instances due to derivation; in others it exists in defiance
of it—as, for instance, in <i>feather</i> and <i>endeavor</i>. Its
insertion was doubtless due to an attempt to represent a sound which
is no longer heard in these words. In a large number of instances they
were once spelled without the now unpronounced letter.</p>

<p>Common also is a third sound of this digraph—the one we call “short
<i>u</i>.” It is heard in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span> <i>heard</i> itself, in <i>earth</i>, in
<i>early</i>, in <i>learn</i>, in <i>search</i>, and in a number
of other words in which <i>ea</i> is followed by <i>r</i>. There
is a fourth sound of it which may be represented by <i>bear</i>,
<i>swear</i>, <i>tear</i>. A fifth sound of it occurs in the words
<i>heart</i>, <i>hearth</i>, and <i>hearken</i>. Again, a sixth sound
of it is represented by such words as <i>great</i>, <i>break</i>,
<i>steak</i>. In all these cases it will be observed that certain
of these words have in the course of their history tended to pass
from one pronunciation of the digraph into another. Sometimes they
have for a long time wavered between the two. <i>Hearth</i>, which
contains the fifth sound just assigned to the combination, was often
made to ryme with words containing the third sound, represented by
<i>earth</i>. According to the New Historical Dictionary, this is true
now of Scotland, and of the Northern English dialect. It is true also
of certain parts of the United States, or, at any rate, of certain
persons. It seems also to have been the pronunciation of Milton.</p>

<p class="poetry">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Far from all resort of mirth</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Save the cricket on the hearth</span><br>
</p>

<p class="p0">are lines found in <i>Il Penseroso</i>. So also <i>great</i> once had
often the first sound here given to the digraph, as if it were spelled
<i>greet</i>. Both this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span> sound as well as the one it now receives
were so equally authorized in the eighteenth century that Dr. Johnson
triumphantly cited the fact as a convincing proof of the impossibility
of making a satisfactory pronouncing dictionary, just as we are now
told that we cannot have a phonetic orthography because men pronounce
the same word in different ways.</p>

<p>The digraph <i>ee</i> having already been considered, we pass on
to <i>ei</i>. Its most frequent sound is that heard in such words
as <i>rein</i>, <i>veil</i>, and <i>neighbor</i>. But it has also
the sound of “long <i>e</i>” in <i>conceit</i>, <i>seize</i>,
<i>ceiling</i>, and a few others. In <i>heir</i> and <i>heiress</i>
and <i>their</i> it has the sound of <i>a</i> in <i>fare</i>. In
<i>height</i> and <i>sleight</i> it has the sound of “long <i>i</i>.”
In <i>heifer</i> and <i>nonpareil</i> it has the sound of short
<i>e</i>. The allied digraph <i>ey</i> has no such range of sounds. In
accented syllables it represents only the first one given to <i>ei</i>,
as can be seen in <i>they</i>, <i>grey</i>, and <i>survey</i>.
<i>Key</i>, with the sound of “long <i>e</i>,” seems to be the solitary
exception.</p>

<p>It is already plainly apparent that there is nothing in the character
of our present spelling to fit it to serve as a guide to pronunciation,
the very office for which spelling was created. But its worthlessness
in this respect, with the consequent uncertainty and anxiety attending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
the use of it, forms in the case of two words containing the digraph
<i>ei</i>, one of the most amusing episodes in the history of English
orthoepy. In modern times their pronunciation has given rise to
controversy and heart-burnings as bitter as the matter itself is
unimportant. These words are <i>either</i> and <i>neither</i>. Were
they to adopt the most common pronunciation of the digraph they would
have the sound heard in such words as <i>eight</i>, <i>vein</i>, and
<i>feint</i>. This, in truth, they once had. To indicate that fact
they have occasionally been written <i>ayther</i> and <i>nayther</i>.
But this pronunciation, outside of Ireland at least, had largely
disappeared by the latter part of the eighteenth century. So far
as many orthoepists were concerned, it was ignored entirely. Those
who mentioned it often accorded it scant favor. The affections
of lexicographers were long divided between the sounds heard in
<i>receive</i> and <i>deceit</i>, and that heard in <i>height</i> and
<i>sleight</i>. For the former there was a very marked preference.
Most of them did not even admit the existence of the “long <i>i</i>”
sound; those who did, gave it generally a grudging recognition. The
various pronunciations prevailing in the latter part of the eighteenth
century were specified by Nares in his <i>Elements of Orthoepy</i>.
“<i>Either</i> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span> <i>neither</i>,” he wrote, “are spoken by some with
the sound of long <i>i</i>. I have heard even that of long <i>a</i>
given to them; but as the regular way is also in use, I think it is
preferable. These differences seem to have arisen from ignorance of the
regular sound of <i>ei</i>.” As the regular sound of <i>ei</i>, if any
one of them is entitled to that designation, is heard in such words as
<i>skein</i> and <i>freight</i>, one gets the impression that Nares
himself was ignorant of what it was.</p>

<p>Walker, the orthoepic lawgiver of our fathers, distinctly preferred
the “long <i>e</i>” sound of <i>either</i> and <i>neither</i>. Both
the practice of Garrick and analogy led him to maintain that they
should be pronounced as if ryming “with breather, one who breathes.”
He was compelled, however, to admit that the “long <i>i</i>” sound was
heard so frequently that it was hardly possible in insist exclusively
upon the other. He did the best he could, nevertheless, to ignore it
and thereby banish it. While in the introduction to his dictionary
he recognized the existence of both sounds, in the body of his work
that of “long <i>e</i>” was the only one given. In this course he was
followed by his reviser, Smart, who succeeded to his name, and up to
a certain degree to his authority. Smart went even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span> further than his
predecessor. He was apparently ignorant of the fact—he certainly
ignored it—that any other pronunciation of these words than that of
“long <i>e</i>” was known to the English people. But in spite of its
defiance of analogy and of the hostility of lexicographers, the sound
of “long <i>i</i>” continued to make its way. The fact has sometimes
excited the indignation of orthoepists. Yet it is hard to understand
how any one who cherishes the vagaries of English spelling should get
into a state of excitement about the vagaries of its pronunciation.</p>

<p>Neither the digraph <i>eo</i> nor <i>eu</i> is found often. The
first, however, improves fully the opportunity presented of making
it difficult, if not impossible, for the learner to get any idea of
the pronunciation from the spelling. In <i>people</i> it has the
sound of “long <i>e</i>”; in <i>leopard</i> and <i>jeopard</i> it
has the sound of short <i>e</i>. In <i>yeoman</i> again it has the
sound of long <i>o</i>. <i>Eu</i> has practically the same sound as
<i>ew</i>, as can be exemplified in <i>feud</i> and <i>few</i>. This
last digraph, however, represents the long sound of <i>u</i> as well
as that in which iotization precedes the vowel. The difference in
the pronunciation of <i>drew</i> and <i>dew</i> will make manifest
the contrast. There is always a tendency, however, for the digraph
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span> pass from the latter sound to the former in a tongue in which
there is nothing in the orthography to fix a precise value upon the
sign indicating both. “According to my v’oo,” Oliver Wendell Holmes,
in his <i>Elsie Venner</i>, has one of his characters saying. “The
unspeakable pronunciation of this word,” he adds in a parenthesis,
“is the touchstone of New England Brahminism.” In another place in
the same novel he still further enforces this point. “The Doctor,”
he wrote, among his other recommendations to the hero, says to him,
“you can pronounce the word <i>view</i>.” And yet in it the iotization
is plainly indicated by the vowel itself, while in such words as
<i>hew</i> and <i>few</i> and <i>new</i> there is nothing to fix
definitely the sound. Finally, it remains to say of this digraph that
<i>shew</i> and <i>strew</i>, two verbs once spelled with it, have
now become <i>show</i> and <i>strow</i>, a form more in accordance
with their pronunciation. There is no particular reason why <i>sew</i>
should not follow their example in substituting an <i>o</i> for an
<i>e</i>.</p>

<p>The digraph <i>ie</i> is represented but by three vowel sounds.
The most common one is that of “long <i>e</i>”—seen, for example,
in <i>chief</i>, <i>grieve</i>, <i>believe</i>. But the sound of
“long <i>i</i>” is heard in no small number of words, especially
monosyllabic words ending in <i>ie</i>, such as <i>lie</i>, <i>die</i>,
<i>tie</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span> In one instance it has the sound of short <i>e</i>.
Accordingly, in it the first vowel is distinctly superfluous. This is
the word <i>friend</i>. Its Anglo-Saxon original is <i>freónd</i>,
just as that of <i>fiend</i> is <i>feónd</i> or <i>fiónd</i>. One of
the small jokes of the opponents of spelling reform is a professed
unwillingness “to knock the eye out of a friend.” Disparaging remarks
have been made about this as an argument—as it seems to me, with no
justification. Compared with most of the objections brought against the
efforts to wash the dirty face of our orthography and make it decently
presentable, this particular argument against dropping the <i>i</i>
out of <i>friend</i> is, as I look at it, the strongest that has been
or can be adduced. It reminds one, indeed, of the objection the French
writer made to the dropping of the <i>h</i> out of <i>rhinoceros</i>.
The animal would lose his horn and become nothing more than a sheep.</p>

<p>As a matter of linguistic history, however, it was not until late in
the sixteenth century that the <i>i</i>, though found long before,
appeared in the word <i>friend</i> to an extent worth considering.
There were several ways in which it had been spelled previously. Of
these <i>frend</i> was naturally a common one in days when the belief
still lingered that the office of orthography<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span> was to represent
pronunciation and not to get as far away from it as possible. Take,
as an illustration, the treatise entitled <i>The Schoolmaster</i> of
the great English scholar, Roger Ascham. This appeared in 1570. In it
the word <i>friend</i> occurs just twenty-five times. It is regularly
spelled <i>frend</i>, with the exception of one instance, where the
intruding <i>i</i> is found. So also <i>frendly</i> is invariably the
form of the adjective, and <i>frendship</i> that of the derivative
noun.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p><i>Oa</i>, the next digraph in order, comes very near attaining the
distinction of being represented by a single sound. It occurs in a
fairly large number of words which can be represented by <i>oar</i>,
<i>coat</i>, <i>loaf</i>. It is saved, however, from the reproach
of regularity by having the sound of the <i>a</i> of “ball” in the
words <i>broad</i>, <i>abroad</i>, and <i>groat</i>. <i>Oe</i> is not
so common, but, like its reverse <i>eo</i>, what it lacks in number
of words it makes up in variety of pronunciation. In <i>foe</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
<i>hoe</i>, and <i>toe</i> it has the sound of long <i>o</i>. In
<i>canoe</i> and <i>shoe</i> it has the sound of long <i>u</i>.
In these instances it forms the termination of words. Not so in
<i>does</i>, where it has the sound we call “short <i>u</i>.” The use
of this digraph, like that of <i>ae</i>, has been much restricted. For
instance, the word we now spell <i>fetid</i> was once generally spelled
<i>fœtid</i>. So, in truth, it continued to be till the nineteenth
century. The digraph, indeed, still lingers in the name of the drug
<i>asafœtida</i>, though in the instance of this word the long sound
has given way to the short. Not unlike, in some particulars, has been
the fortune of certain other terms. Take, for instance, the word
<i>economy</i>. Its remote Greek original began with <i>oi</i>, which
in English, as in Latin, appeared with the form <i>œ</i>, and sometimes
erroneously <i>æ</i>. For these was found occasionally the simple
<i>e</i>. In the nineteenth century this last displaced the two others,
and gave to the first syllable the present standard form. One of the
results, however, of this sort of substitution is that no one seems
to be certain whether he ought to pronounce the initial <i>e</i> of
<i>economic</i> as long or short.</p>

<p>The ordinary sound of <i>oo</i>, the next digraph to be considered,
is that of long <i>u</i>, as we see it in <i>moon</i>, <i>soon</i>,
<i>food</i>. But there are about half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span> a dozen words—throwing
derivatives out of consideration—in which it has the short sound
of <i>u</i>. The difference can be plainly observed by contrasting
the pronunciation of the digraph in the two words <i>mood</i> and
<i>wood</i>. Furthermore, <i>oo</i> is to be credited with two more
sounds. One is that of the “short <i>u</i>” seen in <i>blood</i> and
<i>flood</i>. The other is the long sound of <i>o</i> in <i>door</i>
and <i>floor</i>, anciently spelled <i>dore</i> and <i>flore</i>.
<i>Dore</i>, for instance, can be found in Chaucer, Shakespeare,
Milton, and even as late as Bunyan.</p>

<p>The digraph <i>ou</i> is perhaps the banner sign for the frequency of
its occurrence and the variety of sounds it indicates. As it appears
most commonly, it is a genuine diphthong, as seen in such words as
<i>loud</i>, <i>sour</i>, <i>mouth</i>. But there is another large body
of words in which the sign has a sound essentially distinct. It can
be observed in such words as <i>group</i>, <i>youth</i>, <i>tour</i>.
It gives one a peculiar idea of the worth of English orthography as a
guide to pronunciation that in <i>thou</i>, the singular of the pronoun
of the second person, <i>ou</i> has one value, and in its plural,
<i>you</i>, it has a value altogether different. The same observation
is true of the possessives <i>our</i> and <i>your</i>. There are two
or three words in which these two signs have had for a long period
a struggle for the ascendancy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span> Take the case of the substantive
<i>wound</i>. One gets the impression from poetry that in this word the
<i>ou</i> constitutes a genuine diphthong. There is no question that
it rymes regularly with words containing the diphthongal sound here
given. Perhaps that was a necessity; it had to ryme with such or not
ryme at all. Still, the verse seems pretty surely to have represented
the common pronunciation. In the couplets of Pope, the poetic
authority of the eighteenth century, it is joined, for instance, with
<i>bound</i>, <i>found</i>, <i>ground</i>. Yet this same pronunciation
was unequivocally condemned by Walker at the end of the same century.
“To <i>wound</i>,” he writes, “is sometimes pronounced so as to rhyme
with <i>found</i>; but this is directly contrary to the best usage.”</p>

<p>This same uncertainty in the pronunciation of words in consequence of
the uncertainty of the pronunciation of the signs employed to represent
it may be further exemplified in the case of the noun <i>route</i>.
Unlike <i>wound</i>, which is a pure native word, this is of French
extraction. Following the analogy of most of the words so derived,
it ought to have the second sound given here to the digraph. Yet it
not unfrequently receives that of the first. Thus Walker graciously
tells us that it is often pronounced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span> so as to ryme with <i>doubt</i>
“by respectable speakers.” A far more interesting case is that of
<i>pour</i>. The majority of eighteenth century orthoepists—Johnston,
Kenrick, Perry, Smith, and Walker—pronounced the word so as to
ryme with <i>power</i>. Spenser so employed it. So did Pope, more
than a century later. In the only two instances he uses the word in
his regular poetry at the end of a line it has this sound. In his
<i>Messiah</i> occurs the following couplet:</p>

<p class="poetry">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ye Heavens! from high the dewy nectar pour:</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in soft silence shed the kindly shower.</span><br>
</p>

<p>Walker, indeed, declared unreservedly that the best pronunciation of
it is “that similar to <i>power</i>.” Nares alone among eighteenth
century orthoepists seems to have upheld what is now the customary
pronunciation; yet even here the authority of some of the greatest of
modern poets has been occasionally cast in favor of the once accepted
sound. In his poem of <i>The Poet’s Mind</i>, Tennyson, for instance,
writes:</p>

<p class="poetry">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Holy water will I pour</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into every spicy flower.</span><br>
</p>

<p>The digraph is far from being limited to the sounds heard respectively
in <i>thou</i> and <i>you</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span> Another one is that of long
<i>o</i>, found, for illustration, in <i>dough</i>, <i>soul</i>,
<i>mould</i>. There is still another sound—that of the so-called
“broad <i>a</i>”—which is heard in <i>brought</i>, <i>ought</i>,
and <i>wrought</i>. A fifth sound represented is that of the
regular short <i>u</i> seen in <i>would</i>, <i>could</i>, and
<i>should</i>. In <i>cough</i> and <i>trough</i>, as pronounced by
many, there is a sixth sound represented. In the course of its travels
through the vowel sounds the sign reaches that which we commonly
call “short <i>u</i>.” There is no small number of words in which
this pronunciation of it appears. <i>Country</i>, <i>journey</i>,
<i>trouble</i>, <i>flourish</i> may be given as examples. <i>Ou</i>,
in truth, has a remarkable record, not so much by the number of
sounds it represents—in this it is approached by two or three other
digraphs—but by the comparative largeness of the body of words
in which several of these different sounds appear. In the latter
respect, but not at all in the former, is it rivalled by the analogous
<i>ow</i>. This, common as it is, has but two sounds. The first
and most frequent is that heard in <i>brown</i>, <i>down</i>, and
<i>vowel</i>; the second is the long <i>o</i> sound heard in such words
as <i>blow</i>, <i>grow</i>, and <i>below</i>.</p>

<p>We now reach the digraphs of which the vowel <i>u</i> is the first
letter. In a large number of words this has, if pronounced, the sound
of <i>w</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span> Especially is this true of syllables upon which no accent
falls, or at most a secondary accent. Nothing of this characteristic
is seen in the case of <i>uy</i>—in which the diphthongal sound of
<i>i</i> is heard in the two words <i>buy</i> and <i>guy</i>—but
it is noticeable in the case of the first four vowels. We can see
it illustrated by the <i>ua</i> of <i>assuage</i>, <i>persuade</i>,
<i>language</i>; by the <i>ue</i> of <i>conquest</i>, <i>request</i>,
and <i>desuetude</i>; by the <i>ui</i> of <i>anguish</i>,
<i>languish</i>, <i>cuirass</i>; and by the <i>uo</i> of <i>quote</i>,
<i>quota</i>, <i>quorum</i>. In this last case the <i>u</i> strictly
belongs with <i>q</i>. Of <i>ua</i>, the first of these digraphs, all
that needs to be said is that in certain words, such as <i>guard</i>
and <i>guardian</i>, the <i>u</i> is not pronounced at all. The same
statement can be made of <i>ue</i> in <i>guess</i>, <i>guest</i>,
<i>guerdon</i>. It is as useless as it is silent. A plea has been put
forth in justification of its existence on the theory that it acts as
a sort of servile instrument to protect the hard sound of <i>g</i>.
If this digraph were invariably so employed, it may be conceded that
there would be some sense in its existence. But he who expects to
find either sense or consistency in English orthography has strayed
beyond the limits of justifiable ignorance. There is a large number of
instances in which the consonant <i>g</i> continues to exhibit its hard
sound when followed directly by <i>e</i>. <i>Get</i> and <i>geese</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
and <i>gewgaw</i> and <i>eager</i> and <i>anger</i> are a few of the
words which could be adduced to show that there has never been felt any
necessity of the presence of a protecting <i>u</i> to indicate this
pronunciation.</p>

<p>When at the end of a word the digraph <i>ue</i> has often the sound
of long <i>u</i>, as in <i>blue</i>, <i>pursue</i>, <i>true</i>, and
<i>rue</i>. But no small number of instances occur in which it is
entirely silent. This is especially noticeable in words derived from
the Greek which have the final syllables <i>logue</i> or <i>gogue</i>.
<i>Catalogue</i>, <i>prologue</i>, <i>dialogue</i>, <i>demagogue</i>,
<i>pedagogue</i>, and <i>synagogue</i> will serve as examples. But
the list of words in which this digraph is silent is far from being
confined to those with these two terminations. <i>Antique</i>,
<i>oblique</i>, <i>intrigue</i>, <i>colleague</i>, <i>fatigue</i>,
<i>rogue</i>, and <i>plague</i> will testify to the uselessness of it
as far as pronunciation is concerned, unless it be maintained that it
justifies its existence by indicating that the preceding vowel has a
long sound. If this be true, it ought not to appear when the vowel
is short. One sees so much of the results of freak and wantonness in
our spelling that it is permissible to cherish the fancy that any
intelligent principle has been sometime somewhere at work in it, and
that a feeling of this kind was the unconscious motive that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span> led
to the adoption of <i>packet</i> in place of <i>pacquet</i> and of
<i>lackey</i> for <i>lacquey</i>; at any rate, of <i>risk</i> for the
once prevalent <i>risque</i> and of <i>check</i> for <i>cheque</i>. But
no such reason can be assigned for the <i>ue</i> of <i>tongue</i>. Its
original was <i>tunge</i>. The final <i>e</i> ceased to be pronounced,
and in course of time to be printed. The insertion of a <i>u</i> in the
ending, after the fashion of the French <i>langue</i>, was an act of
combined ignorance and folly.</p>

<p>The digraph <i>ui</i> follows in general the course of <i>ue</i>. As in
the case of the latter the <i>u</i> was found unneeded in <i>guess</i>
and <i>guest</i>, so it is equally unnecessary in <i>guide</i> and
<i>guile</i>. Here again a not dissimilar sort of defence for it has
been set up. Its retention, we are told, is desirable in order to
indicate the diphthongal sound of <i>i</i> in these words. The argument
is as futile as in the case of the preceding digraph. It illustrates
forcibly the capabilities of our spelling in the way of confusing
pronunciation that the same combination which is responsible for
“long <i>i</i>” in <i>guide</i> and <i>guile</i> and <i>disguise</i>
is equally responsible for the short <i>i</i> of <i>guilt</i>,
<i>guinea</i>, and <i>build</i>. With the statement that <i>ui</i> has
still another sound in such words as <i>fruit</i>, <i>bruise</i>, and
<i>recruit</i>, we leave the consideration of the vowels and vowel
sounds. But after the survey of the subject which has just been made,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
no one is likely to pretend that the pronunciation he hears of any one
of these in a strange word will furnish him the least surety that he
will be able to reproduce its authorized form in writing.</p>


<h3>V<br><span class="small">THE CONSONANTS</span></h3>

<p>So much for the vowels. When we come to the consonants we are
approaching much more solid phonetic ground. In a general way, they
have remained faithful to the sounds they were created to indicate.
Not but that here also there is need of reform. This will be made
sufficiently manifest when details are given in the case of individual
letters. But the disorganization of the consonant-system is slight
compared with that of the vowel-system. There is, indeed, a fundamental
difference between the two. With the vowels conformity to any phonetic
law whatever is the exception and not the rule. With the consonants the
reverse is the case. Fortunate it is for the English-speaking race that
such is the fact. Were it otherwise, were there with the consonants
the same degree of irregularity which exists with the vowels, the
same degree of variableness in the representation of sounds, the
same widely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span> prevalent indifference to analogy, knowledge of English
spelling would not be delayed, as it is now, for no more than two or
three years beyond the normal time of its acquisition; it would be the
work of a lifetime. Mastery of it, under existing conditions never
fully gained by some, would in such circumstances never be acquired by
anybody who learned anything else.</p>

<p>There is one pervading characteristic of the consonants which
differentiates their position in the orthography from that of the
vowels. Wherever they appear they have ordinarily the pronunciation
which is theirs by right. Ordinarily, not invariably. There are
exceptions that demand full discussion. Still, the usual way in which
consonants vary from the phonetic standard is not by being pronounced
differently but by not being pronounced at all. In some instances the
useless letter represents the derivation; in others it defies it.
They have been retained in the spelling, though never pronounced,
either because they are found in the primitive from which they came;
or they have been introduced into it under the influence of a false
analogy, or as a consequence of a false derivation. In any reform of
the orthography it may not be desirable in some cases to drop—at all
events at the outset—these now silent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span> letters. It assuredly would
not be so wherever the tendency manifests itself to resume them in
pronunciation.</p>

<p>There are four of the consonants which practically do not vary from
phonetic law. They are never silent; they always indicate the precise
pronunciation which they purport to indicate. In the case of two of
them there is in each a single instance in which the rule does not hold
good. In the preposition <i>of</i>, <i>f</i> has the sound of <i>v</i>.
In the matter of inflection the temptation to retain this letter in
spite of the change of sound has been successfully resisted. So we very
properly say <i>calves</i> and <i>wolves</i> instead of <i>calfs</i>
and <i>wolfs</i>, though this course exhibits what some must feel to
be a scandalous tendency toward phonetic spelling. The other letter is
<i>m</i>. The only exception to its regular pronunciation is found in
the word sometimes spelled <i>comptroller</i>. Here it has the sound
of <i>n</i>. But this has already been pointed out as a well-known
spurious form based upon a spurious derivation. Its first syllable
was supposed to come from the French <i>compter</i> and not from its
real original, the Latin <i>contra</i>. The affection for this corrupt
form now felt by some is in curious contrast with the attitude taken
toward <i>count</i> both as a verb and a noun. These words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span> were
once often spelled like the corresponding French <i>compte</i> and
<i>compter</i>. There was justification for this. They all came from
the remote Latin original <i>computare</i>, in which the <i>p</i> is
found. Naturally this particular spelling was especially prevalent in
the sixteenth century, when derivation ran rampant in the orthography;
but the practice extended much later. Had <i>compt</i> continued in use
and fastened itself upon the language, we can imagine, but we cannot
adequately express, the indignation that would now be felt by many
worthy people at the proposal of any reformer to substitute for it
<i>count</i>, and the picture of ruin to the speech that would be drawn
as a result of such a wanton defiance of the derivation.</p>

<p>Let us now consider the unpronounced consonants. In the remote past
such letters when no longer wanted were regularly dropped. Now they are
as regularly retained. They are retained not because they are needed,
but because they have become familiar to the eye. They naturally fall
into three classes, according as they appear at the beginning, at the
end, or in the middle of a word. To the first class belong <i>g</i>
and <i>k</i> when followed by <i>n</i>; <i>w</i> followed by <i>ho</i>
or by <i>r</i>; and the aspirate <i>h</i>. The failure to pronounce
this last in certain words is too well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span> known to need here more than
a reference. Elsewhere, too, I have given an account of the gradual
resumption of the sound of this letter.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>There are about half a dozen words in which an initial <i>g</i> is
silent. Of these <i>gnaw</i> and <i>gnat</i> may be taken as examples.
There are more than double this number in which an initial <i>k</i>
before the same letter <i>n</i> is not heard. These are adequately
represented, with the different vowels following, by <i>knave</i>,
<i>knee</i>, <i>knife</i>, <i>know</i>, and <i>knuckle</i>. Still
more frequently unsounded is an initial <i>w</i>. There are fully two
dozen and a half of words in which this letter is not pronounced. The
class finds satisfactory exemplification in <i>who</i>, <i>whole</i>,
<i>wrap</i>, <i>wrest</i>, <i>wrist</i>, <i>wrong</i>, and <i>wry</i>.
In making up these numbers it must be kept in mind that neither
derivatives nor compounds are taken into account. Were such to be
included, the list would be largely swelled.</p>

<p>In the cases just considered a letter once sounded has disappeared from
the spoken tongue. The fact of its disappearance from pronunciation
has not, however, induced men, as was once the practice, to discard
it from the written tongue. But there are instances in which the
initial consonant has never been heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span> at all in the utterance of any
speakers. The words to which they belong are of foreign origin. They
come to us with the foreign spelling. In many cases, or rather in most,
they are from the Greek. The conspicuous examples are the <i>c</i>
of <i>czar</i>, now frequently spelled <i>tsar</i> with the <i>t</i>
sounded, the <i>p</i> of <i>psalm</i> and <i>pseudo</i> and of several
compounds in which the <i>psi</i> of the Hellenic alphabet furnishes
the initial letter. The same uselessness extends to <i>ph</i>—seen,
for illustration, in the form <i>phthisic</i>—and to the <i>p</i> of
words of Greek origin beginning with <i>pt</i>. It may be remarked in
passing that there is a curious blunder in the spelling of the name of
the bird called the <i>ptarmigan</i>. This is a pure Celtic word, which
begins with <i>t</i>. To it a <i>p</i> was prefixed, possibly because
it was supposed to be of Greek origin.</p>

<p>The final consonants which are retained in the spelling but are not
heard in the pronunciation are <i>b</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>t</i>,
<i>w</i>, and <i>x</i>. The words possessing them may be divided
into two classes. In one the useless letter has a sort of claim to
existence. It was there originally. Let us begin with the unpronounced
final <i>b</i>. The native words ending in it are <i>climb</i>,
<i>comb</i>, <i>dumb</i>, and <i>lamb</i>. They are common to
the various Teutonic languages. In all of these they terminated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
originally with this consonant. To the list may be added <i>plumb</i>,
‘perpendicular,’ coming remotely from the Latin <i>plumbum</i>,
‘lead.’ The spelling of these words underwent the usual variations
common before a fixed orthography had fastened itself upon the speech.
Naturally the unpronounced <i>b</i> was not unfrequently dropped.
This was especially true of <i>climb</i> and <i>dumb</i>. Take as an
illustration Spenser’s line, where he speaks of a castle-wall,</p>

<p class="poetry">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That was so high as foe might not it clime.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></span><br>
</p>

<p>But after the reign of Elizabeth the useless letter gradually but
firmly fixed its hold upon the spelling in the case of all these
words. In this respect English has had a different development from
that of other Teutonic tongues. Take modern German, for instance.
For the word corresponding to <i>climb</i> it has replaced the
original <i>chlimban</i> by <i>klimmen</i>; for <i>chamb</i>,
‘comb,’ it has substituted <i>kamm</i>; for <i>dumb</i> in Old High
German <i>tumb</i>, it has <i>dumm</i>; for <i>lamb</i>, in Old High
German <i>lamb</i>, it has <i>lamm</i>. The dropping of the final
<i>b</i> seems to have wrought no observable harm to the language nor
occasioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span> any grief—at all events, any present grief—to its users.</p>

<p>Still, it may be maintained in justification of the present spelling of
these words that they are entitled to the final <i>b</i> on the ground
of derivation. But no such plea can be put up in the case of those now
to be considered. These are <i>crumb</i>, <i>limb</i>, <i>numb</i>, and
<i>thumb</i>. In all of these the last letter is not only useless, but
according to the term one chooses to employ, it is either a blunder
or a corruption. It did not exist in the original. In truth, this
unnecessary consonant threatened at one time to fasten itself also
upon the name of the fruit called the <i>plum</i>. Especially was
this noticeable in the best literature of the eighteenth century. An
attack of common sense, to which the users of our orthography have been
occasionally liable, prevented this particular word from carrying about
the burden of the unpronounced <i>b</i>. In the case of most of the
others it was not until the sixteenth century that the practice began
of appending the unauthorized and unneeded letter. It took something of
a struggle to foist it upon these words; but not so much, indeed, as
will be required to loose the hold it has now gained over the hearts of
thousands.</p>

<p>There are a few words, almost all of Latin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span> derivation, in which a
final <i>n</i> appears unsounded. <i>Kiln</i> is perhaps the only
one of English extraction in which this peculiarity appears. In the
case of most of them the retention of the letter may be defended—at
least it may be palliated—on the ground that in the derivatives
its pronunciation is resumed. In <i>autumn</i>, <i>column</i>,
<i>condemn</i>, <i>hymn</i>, and <i>limn</i> the <i>n</i> is silent,
but it gives distinct evidence of its existence in words like
<i>autumnal</i>, <i>columnar</i>, <i>condemnation</i>, <i>hymnal</i>,
<i>limner</i>, and <i>solemnity</i>. In fact, this resumption of
the sound has at times been made to appear in other parts of the
verbs containing this silent letter. Especially has this been true
of <i>hymning</i> and <i>limning</i>, the participles of <i>hymn</i>
and <i>limn</i>. It was a practice which much grieved certain of the
earlier orthoepists. They took the ground that analogy forbade any
sound not belonging to the principal verb itself to be heard in any of
its parts. The observation is only noticeable for its revelation of the
fact that it should enter into the head of any advocate of the existing
orthography to set up analogy as a convincing reason for pronouncing
any English word in a particular way.</p>

<p>Three of these final unpronounced letters do not need protracted
consideration. In the digraph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span> <i>ow</i>, ending such words as
<i>low</i>, <i>flow</i>, and <i>sow</i>, the <i>w</i> serves no
particular use. According to some it justifies its existence by
indicating the quality of the preceding vowel. Its value in this
respect may be estimated by comparing the pronunciation of <i>bow</i>,
a missile weapon for discharging an arrow, with <i>bow</i>, an
inclination of the head, or <i>bow</i>, the fore-end of a boat. The
next letter <i>t</i>, when a final consonant, is invariably heard,
save in some imperfectly naturalized words. Of these <i>eclat</i> and
<i>billet-doux</i> may be taken as examples. In England, however—not
in the United States—there is a single and singular survival of the
original French pronunciation in the case of a word received into
full citizenship. This is the noun <i>trait</i>, which came into the
language in the eighteenth century. Naturally its final letter was
at first not sounded. The tendency so to do, however, soon showed
itself. Lexicographers authorized it, indeed favored it; but for some
inexplicable reason Englishmen have never taken kindly to the complete
naturalization of the word. “The <i>t</i>,” said Walker, at the end of
the eighteenth century, “begins to be pronounced.” Had he been living
at the end of the nineteenth, he would have been justified in saying
precisely the same thing as regards England. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span> beginning then; it
is beginning now; but it is only beginning.</p>

<p>A final <i>h</i> is not pronounced when preceded by a vowel; when
preceded by the consonant <i>g</i> it forms a digraph which will
be considered later. There are fewer than a dozen words of the
former class in which it appears. Among these are the interjections,
<i>ah</i>, <i>eh</i>, and <i>oh</i>. Here again, as in the case of
<i>w</i>, the existence of the letter is defended on the ground that it
indicates the quality of the preceding vowel. Yet for this purpose it
can hardly be deemed a necessity. We use it in the case of <i>ah</i>;
but we get along very well without it in the case of <i>ha</i>. This,
too, was formerly sometimes spelled <i>hah</i>. <i>Oh</i>, likewise,
was once widely found in the very instances and the very senses
where we now use the single letter <i>O</i>. In two other words,
<i>Messiah</i> and <i>hallelujah</i>, the <i>h</i> may be retained
because of the sacredness of associations which have gathered about
them. Yet the former word was itself a sixteenth-century alteration of
the previous <i>Messias</i>.</p>

<p>The unpronounced final <i>k</i> belongs strictly to the class of double
letters of which it is not my purpose to treat. It invariably follows
<i>c</i>, and is really nothing but a duplicate of it. Still, as the
sign is a different representation of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span> same sound, it may be well
to bestow upon it a brief attention. At the end of the eighteenth and
the beginning of the nineteenth century it was dropped, after a warm
contest, from words of Latin derivation. But the reform did not extend
to those of native origin. In many cases a <i>k</i> has been added to
words which originally ended in <i>c</i>. Especially was this true of
monosyllables. Thus the earliest form of <i>back</i> was <i>bæc</i>,
of <i>sack</i> was <i>sac</i>, of <i>sick</i> was <i>seoc</i>. This
was the case not only with a good many monosyllables to which a
<i>k</i> is now appended, but to a certain extent with dissyllables
also. The fact is best exemplified in the words which have the ending
<i>ock</i>. This sometimes represents the early English diminutive
<i>uc</i>, which became later <i>oc</i> or <i>ok</i>. From the point of
view of derivation the modern spelling is distinctly improper. Thus,
for illustration, <i>bullock</i>, <i>haddock</i>, <i>hassock</i>,
<i>hillock</i>, and <i>mattock</i> were in their earliest known forms
<i>bulluc</i>, <i>haddoc</i>, <i>hassuc</i>, <i>hilloc</i>, and
<i>mattuc</i>. Several words not of native origin have also adopted
this ending. <i>Hammock</i>, from the Spanish <i>hamaca</i>, itself of
Carib origin, has conformed to it. It has supplied itself with a final
<i>k</i>. During the last century <i>havoc</i> managed to get rid of
this consonant, with which it had been encumbered, without exciting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
any special remark. But now that the uselessness of a letter has become
to many one of the chief recommendations of the spelling, the dropping
of an unnecessary <i>k</i> from any of the other words of this class
would bring unspeakable anguish to thousands.</p>

<p>There are more consonants which are unpronounced in the middle of
words than at the beginning or the end. They are <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>,
<i>l</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>w</i>,
and <i>z</i>. In the case of some of them—the two last, for
instance—the words in which the unpronounced letter appears are very
few. In <i>rendezvous</i> <i>z</i> is not sounded. It is the only
instance in which this consonant is not heard, and this is due to the
fact that it is not heard in its French original. Again, it is only in
<i>answer</i>, <i>sword</i>, and <i>two</i> that the medial <i>w</i> is
silent. Unpronounced consonants are more frequent in the case of the
other letters, but, after all, they are not numerous in themselves.
Still, their presence has its usual effect. In every instance it raises
a stumbling-block in the way of the proper pronunciation. Furthermore,
it has in some cases either hidden the right derivation entirely or
given a wrong idea of it.</p>

<p>Take the example of the medial <i>b</i> in <i>debt</i> and
<i>doubt</i>. These words, coming originally from the French, were
introduced into the language<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span> with the spelling, <i>dette</i>,
<i>det</i>, and <i>doute</i>, <i>dout</i>. So for a long time they
were spelled. Deference to the remote Latin original, which sprang up
with the revival of learning, introduced the unauthorized <i>b</i>
into the world. It has already been pointed out that this has given
an opportunity, which has been fully improved, for the devotees of
derivation to exhibit their usual inconsistency. When the presence of
unpronounced letters in the case of other words presents an obstacle to
correct pronunciation, then its retention is insisted upon as essential
to our knowledge of its immediate origin, to the purity of the language
itself, and to the happiness of those speaking it. But no advocate of
the existing orthography could be induced to part with the <i>b</i> of
<i>debt</i> and <i>doubt</i>, though its presence comes into direct
conflict with the views he is championing in the case of other words.
At times attempts were apparently made to pronounce the inserted
<i>b</i>. In the full Latinized form <i>debit</i>, which was early in
use, there was no difficulty. Indeed, it was a necessity. Not so in the
form <i>debt</i>. Yet it is evident from <i>Love’s Labour’s Lost</i>
that there were men who sought to accomplish this feat. It is difficult
to ascertain whether speaker or hearer suffered more in consequence of
this effort. If unsuccessful, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span> was the speaker; if successful, the
pain was transferred to the hearer.</p>

<p>One curious blunder has been foisted upon our spelling by the desire
of men to go back to the Latin original of these words instead of
contenting themselves with the immediate French one. The insertion of
<i>b</i> is bad enough in <i>redoubted</i> and <i>redoubtable</i>.
These came to us from the latter tongue, and at first appeared in
English in the forms <i>redouted</i> and <i>redoutable</i>. Later the
classical influence made itself felt and the <i>b</i> was inserted.
Palliation for it could be pleaded on the ground that the letter
belonged to the remote original. But no defence of this sort could
be of avail in the case of the word denoting the military outwork
called a <i>redoubt</i>. This has not the slightest connection either
in sense or origin with the two adjectives just specified. It comes
directly from the French <i>redout</i> and remotely from the Latin
<i>reductus</i>, ‘withdrawn,’ ‘retired,’ which received at a later
period the meaning of ‘a place of refuge.’ But it was ignorantly
supposed that it came from the same source as the verb <i>redoubt</i>
and its past participle <i>redoubted</i>. So from the beginning of the
introduction of the word into the language, in the early part of the
seventeenth century, an unauthorized <i>b</i> was made part of it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
It is now dear to the hearts of millions. What the blundering of one
age perpetrated the superstition of succeeding ages has invested with
peculiar sanctity.</p>

<p>The cases in which <i>c</i> follows <i>s</i> present several choice
examples of the vagaries which make English orthography a wonder to
those who study its history, and a perpetual joy and boast to those
who in this matter succeed in keeping the purity of their ignorance
from being denied by the slightest stain of knowledge. In the words
<i>scene</i>, <i>scepter</i>, and <i>sciatica</i>, coming directly or
remotely from the Greek, the letter represents an original <i>k</i>.
So, useless as it is, its retention may be defended on the ground that
if it be not the same letter, it ought to be, since it has the same
value. The similar apology of respect for derivation may be urged
for the unpronounced <i>c</i> of <i>science</i>, <i>scintilla</i>,
and <i>sciolist</i>. But in the case of <i>scent</i>, <i>scion</i>,
<i>scimitar</i>, <i>scissors</i>, and <i>scythe</i>, no such plea
can be made. In the instance of all these there is not the slightest
justification for the unnecessary <i>c</i>. <i>Scent</i> comes from
the Latin <i>sent-ire</i>, ‘to perceive.’ Until the seventeenth
century it was regularly spelled <i>sent</i>. <i>Scythe</i>, from the
Anglo-Saxon <i>sîthe</i>, once frequently and now occasionally has
its strictly correct etymological form. <i>Scion</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span> is from the old
French <i>sion</i>. <i>Scimitar</i> and <i>scissors</i> have had a
wide variety of spellings during the course of their history. English
orthography has exhibited, as is not unusual, a perverse preference for
the ones which depart furthest from the pronunciation.</p>

<p>The instances where <i>g</i> is silent within a word are those in
which it is found preceding <i>m</i> or <i>n</i>. Its presence it
owes, in most instances, to derivation. Examples of it can be found
in a number of words of Greek extraction, of which <i>paradigm</i>,
<i>diaphragm</i>, and <i>phlegm</i> may be given. With a following
<i>n</i> it can be represented by <i>campaign</i>, <i>feign</i>,
<i>sign</i>, and <i>impugn</i>. As has been the case with the final
<i>n</i> of certain words, so also the pronunciation of the <i>g</i> is
resumed in the derivatives. That may be deemed by some a justification
for its retention in the primitive—at least, for the time being.
With <i>sign</i> we have <i>signify</i>, with <i>malign</i> we have
<i>malignity</i>, with <i>phlegm</i> we have <i>phlegmatic</i>. But
the <i>g</i> is a particularly ridiculous intruder in the words
<i>foreign</i> and <i>sovereign</i>. The former is from the Old
French <i>forein</i>, which itself comes from the popular Latin
<i>foraneus</i>, and this in turn comes from the classical Latin
<i>foras</i>, ‘out of doors.’ <i>Sovereign</i> is a spelling just
as bad. It comes from the Old French <i>sovrain</i>, the Low<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span> Latin
<i>superanus</i>, ‘supreme,’ which was formed upon the preposition
<i>super</i>, ‘above.’ The insertion of a <i>g</i> was a blunder for
which our race has the sole responsibility.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of words in which <i>h</i> is silent following an
initial letter. This is invariably true of words of Greek extraction
beginning with <i>rh</i>. <i>Rhetoric</i>, <i>rheumatic</i>, and
<i>rhubarb</i> may serve as specimens. In these, as in those like
them, the <i>h</i> was wanting in Old French. Consequently, it was at
first wanting in English also. But the deference to derivation which
prevailed among the classically educated after the revival of learning,
raised havoc here with the spelling as it did in so many other
instances. The unpronounced <i>h</i> was inserted into all these words.
This began in the sixteenth century. It gradually established itself
firmly in the orthography. There it has remained ever since, though no
one pretends that it serves any purpose save that of indicating to the
few, who do not need to be informed, that the aspirate existed in the
original from which these words were derived. But even this pitiable
reason cannot be pleaded in the case of the noticeable words in which
<i>h</i> follows an initial <i>g</i>. These are <i>ghastly</i> and
<i>aghast</i>, <i>ghost</i>, and <i>gherkin</i>. In not one of them,
except the last, did <i>h</i> appear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span> till many hundred years after the
words had been in existence. To not one of them does the useless letter
belong by right. Indeed, it was apparently not till the nineteenth
century that it was foisted into <i>gherkin</i> as the regular
spelling, though it had cropped up before. There would be just as much
sense in spelling <i>German</i> as <i>Gherman</i>, and <i>goat</i> as
<i>ghoat</i>, as there is in the intrusion of the <i>h</i> into the
words just mentioned. This is equally true of <i>anchor</i>.</p>

<p>There is, however, one further peculiarity about this letter. In the
spelling of certain words it follows <i>w</i>, in the pronunciation of
them it precedes it. But the fashion of suppressing the sound of the
aspirate in the combination <i>wh</i> is very characteristic of the
speech of England, at least of some parts of it. The prevalence of this
sort of pronunciation which makes no distinction, for example, between
<i>where</i> and <i>wear</i>, between <i>Whig</i> and <i>wig</i>,
between <i>while</i> and <i>wile</i>, was a subject of great, and it
may be added, of justifiable grief to the earlier orthoepists. Walker
complained bitterly of the extent of its use in London. He was anxious
that men should “avoid this feeble Cockney pronunciation which is
so disagreeable to a correct ear.” Fortunately for the speech this
suppression of the aspirate has not extended much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span> beyond the southern
half of England. In America it rarely takes place. There is, therefore,
every likelihood of this pronunciation being eventually crushed, not so
much because of its own inherent viciousness as by the mere weight of
numbers.</p>

<p>There is a limited body of words in which <i>l</i> and <i>p</i> are
silent. The former letter in such cases as <i>balm</i> and <i>calm</i>,
for instance, may perhaps have been effective in preserving the sound
of the preceding vowel. The most signal example of its appearance,
where it has no justification for its existence, is in the word
<i>could</i>. This takes the place of the earlier and more correct
<i>coude</i>, <i>coud</i>. The <i>l</i> was introduced by a false
analogy with <i>would</i> and <i>should</i>. These two last words, it
may be added, at times dropped this letter, to which etymologically
they were entitled, out of deference to the pronunciation, just as
<i>could</i>, though not entitled to it, assumed it in defiance of the
pronunciation.</p>

<p>The most noticeable instances in which <i>p</i> is not pronounced
are when it follows <i>m</i> and is itself followed by <i>t</i>.
<i>Empty</i>, <i>tempt</i>, <i>prompt</i>, and <i>sumptuous</i> will
supply a sufficient number of illustrations. In most of these cases the
letter still appears because it was in the original. In <i>empty</i>,
however, it is a later insertion. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span> are two or three sporadic
instances in which a <i>p</i> is present but fails to be called upon
for duty. Such are <i>raspberry</i> and <i>receipt</i>. In the first
of these two <i>rasberry</i> seems to have been for a long time the
preferred spelling. Unless there is a prospect that the sound of the
letter will be resumed in the pronunciation, there is no apparent
reason why we should not go back to the once more common form. But
<i>receipt</i>, with the allied <i>conceit</i> and <i>deceit</i>,
furnishes as good an illustration as can well be offered of the
vagaries of English orthography, and of the system which has prevailed
in and the sense which has presided over its development. These three
words all come remotely from the three closely allied participial forms
<i>receptus</i>, <i>conceptus</i>, and <i>deceptus</i>. The earlier
most common spelling of the first was <i>receit</i> or <i>receyt</i>.
While the form with the inserted <i>p</i> existed previously, it was
not till the Elizabethan period that it began to be much in evidence.
Furthermore, it was not till the latter part of the seventeenth century
that the unnecessary letter established itself in the unfortunate word.
<i>Conceit</i> and <i>deceit</i> went through what was in many respects
the same experience. The forms <i>conceipt</i> and <i>deceipt</i> were
found not unfrequently. But in them the <i>p</i> failed to maintain
itself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span> So words from a common Latin root have developed two different
ways of spelling, with not the slightest reason in the nature of things
why any distinction whatever should be made between them.</p>

<p>The silence of <i>s</i> in some few words, such as <i>isle</i>,
<i>aisle</i>, and <i>island</i>, has already been mentioned. In
<i>viscount</i> it is also suppressed, doubtless in deference to
the French original. But in the middle of words <i>t</i> is far
more frequently left unpronounced than <i>s</i>. This is especially
noticeable when it is followed by <i>le</i> on the one hand, as can be
seen in <i>castle</i>, <i>wrestle</i>, <i>thistle</i>, <i>ostler</i>,
and <i>rustle</i>; on the other hand, when followed by <i>en</i>, as in
<i>fasten</i>, <i>hasten</i>, <i>listen</i>, and <i>moisten</i>. There
are a few other words besides those with these endings in which it is
silent. Such are <i>Christmas</i>, <i>chestnut</i>, <i>mortgage</i>,
<i>bankruptcy</i>. That it should not be heard in words of French
origin like <i>billet-doux</i> and <i>hautbois</i> is not hard to
understand; they have never been fully naturalized.</p>

<p>This exhausts the list of simple consonants that are found in the
written language, but are not heard in the spoken. There remains,
however, a digraph which is encountered too frequently not to receive
brief mention. This is <i>gh</i>, both at the end and in the middle
of words. In these positions it once stood for something.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span> It had,
therefore, originally a right to the place in which it now appears. But
the guttural sound it indicated disappeared long ago from the usage of
all of us. Even the knowledge that it had ever existed has disappeared
from the memory of most of us, if it was ever found there. Accordingly
it serves now no other purpose than to act as a sort of tombstone to
mark the place where lie the unsightly remains of a dead and forgotten
pronunciation. The useless digraph is still seen at the end of numerous
words of which <i>weigh</i>, <i>high</i>, and <i>dough</i> may be
taken as examples. Again an unpronounced medial <i>gh</i> is seen in
<i>neighbor</i> and a large number of words ending in <i>ght</i>, such
as <i>caught</i>, <i>height</i>, <i>fight</i>, and <i>thought</i>. In
many of these words the digraph was frequently dropped in those earlier
days when there was a perverse propensity to make the spelling show
some respect to the pronunciation. <i>High</i>, for instance, often
appeared in the forms <i>hye</i>, <i>hy</i>; <i>nigh</i> in the forms
<i>nye</i>, <i>ny</i>. This is now all changed. The disposition to
pander to any sneaking desire to bring about a scandalous conformity
between orthography and orthoepy is steadily frowned upon by those
who have been good enough to take upon their shoulders the burden of
preserving what they are pleased to call the purity of the English
language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>This survey of the subject, brief as it is, brings out distinctly the
superiority of the consonant system over the vowel, in the matter of
unpronounced letters. Far from perfect as is the former, it shines by
contrast with the latter. The useless consonant appears in but a few
words, where the useless vowel appears in scores. But when we pass on
to the cases in which the sign is represented by any but its legitimate
sound, the contrast between the two classes of letters becomes far
more noticeable. It is the superiority in this particular which
alone makes our present spelling endurable. Most of the consonants,
if pronounced at all, have in all cases one and the same sound. Any
possible acquisition of the speech in the term of a man’s natural life
has depended upon the fact that these members of the alphabet are in
general really phonetic. Their faithfulness to their legitimate sounds
stands in sharpest contrast to the almost hopeless disorganization
which has overtaken the vowels. In the case of some of the consonants
there is never any variation from their proper pronunciation. In the
case of others the exceptions to the regular practice are purely
sporadic. The <i>p</i> of <i>cupboard</i>, for instance, has the
sound of <i>b</i>, the <i>j</i> of <i>hallelujah</i> has the sound of
<i>y</i>. Even these exceptions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span> which have prevailed in the past there
has been a tendency to reduce, owing to the operation of agencies of
which there will be occasion to speak later.</p>

<p>This last statement needs modification in the case of one letter.
In modern times there has been a tendency to represent the sound of
<i>t</i> in the preterite and past participle by <i>d</i>, or, rather,
<i>ed</i>. As compared with the usage of the past, this practice
has made a good deal of headway. It is the substitution of a formal
regularity of spelling which appeals to the eye over its proper use to
indicate the sound to the ear. We have not yet got so far as to write
<i>sleeped</i> for <i>slept</i> or <i>feeled</i> for <i>felt</i>, but
we have frequently <i>dwelled</i> for <i>dwelt</i> and <i>builded</i>
for <i>built</i>. This is all proper enough if the <i>d</i> sound is
given to the ending by pronouncing the word, as is often done, as a
dissylable. But no reason can be pleaded for it if <i>t</i> is heard as
the termination. In this matter we are far behind our fathers.</p>

<p>Take the usage of Spenser, as illustrated on this point in the first
canto of the first book of the <i>Faerie Queene</i>. This contains
about five hundred lines. In every case whenever a preterite or past
participle has the sound of <i>t</i>, it is spelled with <i>t</i>.
In this one canto—and it fairly represents all the others—can be
found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span> the preterites <i>advaunst</i>, <i>approcht</i>, <i>chaunst</i>,
<i>enhaunst</i>, <i>forst</i>, <i>glaunst</i>, <i>grypt</i>,
<i>knockt</i>, <i>lept</i>, <i>lookt</i>, <i>nurst</i>, <i>pusht</i>,
<i>y-rockt</i>, <i>stopt</i>, and <i>tost</i>. Along with these
are to be seen as past participles <i>accurst</i>, <i>enforst</i>,
<i>mixt</i>, <i>past</i>, <i>promist</i>, <i>stretcht</i>,
<i>vanquisht</i>, and <i>wrapt</i>. Now, to a certain extent this
is an unfair illustration. No one can read the <i>Faerie Queene</i>
without becoming aware that Spenser was a good deal of a spelling
reformer. Necessarily, he was largely dominated by the ignoble idea
that orthography should have a close connection with the pronunciation.
Still, though in certain particulars he took very advanced ground, he
only practiced on a large scale what on a small scale was followed by
very many of his contemporaries and immediate successors.</p>

<p>We pass on now to the consideration of the six sounds for which the
alphabet has no special sign whatever. Two of them are the surd and
sonant sounds, already considered, for which the digraph <i>th</i> has
become the common representative. It may be right to add that this same
digraph is also equivalent in a few cases to the simple <i>t</i>, as in
<i>thyme</i> and <i>Thames</i>. The four other sounds can be recognized
perhaps most easily in the <i>ch</i> of <i>church</i>, the <i>ng</i>
of <i>bring</i>, the <i>sh</i> of <i>ship</i>, and the <i>s</i> of
<i>pleasure</i>. But here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span> as elsewhere in our orthography, reigns
the usual lawlessness. The signs here given represent other sounds
than those just specified. Take the case of <i>ng</i>. Any one can
detect at once the difference in the pronunciation of this digraph by
contrasting it as heard in <i>singer</i> and as heard in <i>finger</i>.
Nor has <i>ch</i> been limited to the sound indicated in <i>chair</i>,
<i>cheer</i>, <i>child</i>, <i>choose</i>, and <i>churn</i>. It has
another, perhaps more frequently denoted by <i>sh</i> in the beginning,
middle, and end of words, as, for illustration, in <i>chaise</i>,
<i>machine</i>, and <i>bench</i>. It has likewise the sound of
<i>k</i> in many words, especially in those of Greek origin, such as
<i>character</i>, <i>mechanic</i>, <i>monarch</i>. The uncertainty
caused by this variety of pronunciation is particularly noticeable
in words in which <i>arch</i> appears as the initial syllable. In
<i>archangel</i>, for instance, <i>ch</i> has one pronunciation, in
<i>archbishop</i> it has another. The difference between the two
must therefore be painfully learned. There is, furthermore, the
sporadic example of <i>choir</i>, in which <i>ch</i> has the sound of
<i>kw</i>, ordinarily represented by <i>qu</i>. But <i>choir</i> was
a late seventeenth-century importation into the language. Though to
some extent it has replaced the original form <i>quire</i>, it has
invariably retained the pronunciation of that word.</p>

<p>Finally, there are the two sounds specified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span> above, as denoted by
the <i>s</i> of <i>pleasure</i> and the <i>sh</i> of <i>ship</i>.
The former has a respectable number of signs to indicate it. Besides
the <i>s</i> found in such words as <i>measure</i>, <i>usury</i>,
<i>enclosure</i>, it is represented by <i>si</i>, as seen in
<i>decision</i>, <i>evasion</i>, <i>occasion</i>; by <i>z</i>, as
in <i>azure</i>, <i>razure</i>, <i>seizure</i>; by <i>zi</i>, as
in <i>glazier</i>, <i>grazier</i>, <i>vizier</i>. It is, however,
the second of these sounds that has the greatest variety of signs
to denote it. In this respect it rivals many of the vowels or vowel
combinations, and surpasses some of them. It is heard in the <i>ce</i>
of <i>ocean</i>, and in particular in no small number of words mainly
scientific, with the ending <i>aceous</i>, such as <i>cretaceous</i>
and <i>cetaceous</i>; in the <i>ci</i> of words like <i>social</i>,
<i>gracious</i>, <i>suspicion</i>; in the <i>s</i> of <i>sure</i>,
<i>sugar</i>, <i>censure</i>, <i>nauseate</i>; in the <i>t</i> of
<i>satiate</i>, <i>expatiate</i>, <i>substantiate</i>; in the <i>ti</i>
of <i>martial</i>, <i>patient</i>, <i>nation</i>, and the vast number
of words which have the termination <i>tion</i>; in <i>xi</i> in
<i>anxious</i>, <i>obnoxious</i>, <i>complexion</i>; in <i>sci</i>
in <i>conscience</i>, <i>prescience</i>; in <i>si</i>, as seen in
no small number of words, such as <i>mansion</i>, <i>vision</i>,
<i>explosion</i>. Finally, to illustrate the confusion which in
the case of these signs has been still further confounded, we may
instance the <i>ci</i> of <i>social</i> with the pronunciation just
indicated, and the <i>ci</i> of the related word <i>society</i> with
a pronunciation entirely different. A precisely similar observation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
could be made of <i>ti</i> in the case of the words <i>satiate</i> and
<i>satiety</i>.</p>

<p>Enough has certainly now been said to put beyond question the fact
of the irrepressible conflict which goes on in our language between
orthography and orthoepy, and to make clear its nature. The treatment
of the subject has, indeed, been far from complete. Nothing whatever
has been said on the large subject of the representation of sounds
in the unaccented syllables. No account has been given of the usage
of some of the letters or combinations of letters. In particular, in
the matter of doubling the letters both in accented and unaccented
syllables, contradictions and incongruities abound with us on a scale
which ought to bring peculiar happiness to those devotees of the
present orthography who believe that the worse a language is spelled
the more distinctly it is to its credit. Still, of this characteristic
there has been no consideration. Furthermore, page after page could
have been taken up with illustrative examples of the anarchy of all
sorts which reigns in every nook and corner of our spelling. We write,
for instance, <i>knowledge</i> with a <i>d</i>; but the place with
the same terminating syllable where we go presumably to acquire it,
which we call a <i>college</i>, we are careful to write without a
<i>d</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span> In the past one finds at times the forms <i>knowlege</i> and
<i>colledge</i>. It is nothing but an accident of usage that we are not
employing them now instead of the ones we have adopted.</p>

<p>It would be easy to go on multiplying examples of these
inconsistencies. But though all that could be said is far from having
been said, surely enough has been given to prove beyond possibility
of denial the existence of the chaotic condition which prevails.
Furthermore, while the subject has been by no means exhausted, the
same statement cannot safely be made of the patience of the reader,
to say nothing of that of the writer. If any one of the former body
finds it tedious to wade through the account of the situation which
has been given in the preceding pages, let him bear in mind how much
more tedious it was for the author to prepare it. If he finds it
exceedingly tedious, let him take to himself a sort of consolation in
the reflection of how easily it could have been made even more so.
Instead, therefore, of complaining of the abundance of minute detail
which I have supplied, he ought to be thankful to me for keeping back
so much of it as I have done. Moreover, as Heine pointed out long ago,
the reader has at his command a resource to which he can always betake
himself when his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span> powers of endurance give out. He can skip. This is a
blessed privilege denied to the writer.</p>

<p>Incomplete, however, as has been the survey of the subject, it has been
sufficient to give a fairly satisfactory idea of the way in which the
orthography represents, or rather misrepresents, the pronunciation. It
makes manifest beyond dispute the truth of the intimation conveyed at
the outset that the form of a particular word is often, with us, little
more than a fortuitous concourse of unrelated letters in which neither
they nor the combinations into which they enter can be relied upon to
indicate any particular sound. In addition, hundreds of those which
appear in the spelling have no office in the pronunciation. Genuine
derivation has led to the retention of some, spurious derivation to
the introduction of others. There are, consequently, few of the common
words of our language which cannot be spelled with perfect propriety
in different ways, sometimes in half a dozen different ways, if the
analogy be followed of words similarly formed and pronounced. Our
orthography is, therefore, often a matter of contention and always a
matter of study. Knowledge of the accepted form of words must be gained
in each case independently, for there exists no general principle, the
observance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span> which will guide the learner to a correct conclusion.</p>

<p>As an inevitable result, the acquisition of spelling never calls into
exercise, with us, the reasoning faculties. On the contrary, its direct
effect is to keep them in abeyance. The ability to spell properly is
an intellectual act only to the extent that attention and recollection
are intellectual acts. It can and not unfrequently does characterize
persons who are very far from being gifted with much mental power. All
who attain proficiency in it are compelled to spend time which, under
proper conditions, could have been far more profitably employed. There
are men who do not attain it at an early age, and some even who never
attain it at all. Moore, for illustration, speaking of Byron, tells us
that spelling was “a very late accomplishment with him.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The case
of William Morris was far worse. This poet never learned to spell at
all. The fact is recorded by his biographer. In speaking of the beauty
of his handwriting, he had to admit the failure of his orthography to
reach the standard set by it. “The subsidiary art of spelling,” he
writes, “was always one in which he was liable to make curious lapses.
‘I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span> remember,’ the poet once said, ‘being taught to spell and standing
on a chair with my shoes off because I made so many mistakes.’ In
later years several sheets of <i>The Life and Death of Jason</i> had
to be cancelled and reprinted because of a mistake in the spelling of
a perfectly common English word; a word, indeed, so common that the
printer’s reader had left it as it was in the manuscript, thinking that
Morris’ spelling must be an intentional peculiarity.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The ignorance which exists in regard to the orthographic situation is
bad enough; but the superstition which has been born of it is still
worse. It is assumed to have come down to us pure and perfect from a
remote past. Hence, it must be religiously preserved in all its assumed
sacredness and genuine uncouthness. Even improvements which could be
made with little difficulty, which would have no other result than
bringing about with the least possible friction uniformity in certain
classes of words—these slight alterations are assailed with almost
as much earnestness and virulence as would be encountered by sweeping
changes designed to make the spelling really phonetic.</p>

<p>As men are more apt to be interested in particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span> illustrations than
in general discussion, it may be worth while to follow up the survey
of the situation which has just been given with an account in detail
of the history of a special class of words. In this once prevailed the
tendency to bring about absolute uniformity. The movement was arrested
before the desired result was attained. It left a few over thirty
examples as exceptions to the general practice. In the derivatives
of some of these it went back to the regular rule and consequently
contributed exceptions to the exceptions. This condition of things has
endeared these anomalies to the hearts of thousands. The class itself
consists of the words ending in <i>or</i> or <i>our</i>. About the
proper way of spelling this termination controversy has raged for more
than a hundred years. The examination of the whole class can be best
carried on by selecting one of the words belonging to it as typical of
all. To its story the next chapter will be largely confined.</p>

<p>“Well, honor is the subject of my story,” says Cassius to Brutus, in
his effort to persuade his friend to join the conspiracy against the
dictator. It was h-o-n-o-r however that he spoke of, not h-o-n-o-u-r.
So the word appeared in the folio of 1623, in which the play of
<i>Julius Cæsar</i> was published for the first time. Unfortunately,
the spelling of Shakespeare has not escaped the tampering to which
that of nearly all our authors has been subjected by unscrupulous
modern editors and publishers. Take the following speech of Brutus,
found shortly before the line already quoted, as it is printed in the

<p>In defiance of the authority of Shakespeare, so far as it is
represented by the folio of 1623,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span> <i>honor</i> in the passages cited
above appears in modern editions as <i>honour</i>. This spelling did
not make its appearance in them until comparatively late. In the second
folio of 1632 the word was still <i>honor</i>. So it remained in the
third folio of 1663-64. It was not till the edition of 1685, the
last and poorest of the folios, that the corrupt form <i>honour</i>
displaced in these passages the original form <i>honor</i>. There it
has since been generally, if not universally, retained.</p>

<p>It is fair to say that in this method of spelling the word the usage
of Shakespeare was far from invariable. Either one of the two forms
just given seems to have been used by him indifferently, just as they
were by his contemporaries. In his writings <i>honor</i>, either as
a verb or noun, occurs very nearly seven hundred times. According to
the sufficient authority of the New Historical English Dictionary, the
spelling <i>honor</i> in the folio of 1623 was “about twice as frequent
as <i>honour</i>.” This confirms my own impressions; but these were
based merely upon the examination of only about a hundred passages of
the seven hundred in which the word occurs. Furthermore, Shakespeare’s
practice varied widely in the use of individual words of this class, as
exemplified in the two poems he himself published. <i>Humor</i> appears
in them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span> twice. In both instances it is without the <i>u</i>—once in
<i>Venus and Adonis</i>,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> once in <i>The Rape of Lucrece</i>.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Such also is the spelling of the word the two times it is found in
the <i>Sonnets</i>,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> but there this fact does not make certain the
practice of the poet. On the other hand, <i>labor</i>, either as a noun
or verb appears seven times in the two pieces just mentioned. Six times
out of the seven it is spelled <i>labour</i>.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> <i>Color</i> also
appears invariably as <i>colour</i> in the ten times the word is found
in these same poems.</p>

<p>The words with the terminations <i>or</i> or <i>our</i> number now
several hundred in our speech. Many of them go back to that early
period when the French element was first introduced into English. Many
others have been added at various periods since. In the case of those
of earlier introduction both terminations are found. Still, it is the
impression produced upon me by my comparatively little reading that
there was at first a distinct preference for the ending <i>our</i>.
This, if true, was due largely, if not mainly, to the fact that it
reflected more accurately the then prevailing pronunciation. The
accent fell upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span> the end of the word. It was not, as now, thrown back
upon the penult or antepenult, with the result of placing only the
slightest of stress upon the final syllable. However this may be, many
words were once often spelled with the termination <i>our</i>, which
have now replaced it by the termination <i>or</i>. The ryme-index
to Chaucer’s poetry shows that he uses about forty words with this
ending at the close of a line. Some are obsolete, but most are still
in current use. Among these latter so spelled are <i>ambassadour</i>,
<i>confessour</i>, <i>emperour</i>, <i>governour</i>, <i>mirrour</i>,
<i>senatour</i>, <i>servitour</i>, <i>successour</i>, and
<i>traitour</i>. These in modern English have replaced the ending
<i>our</i> by <i>or</i>. Again other words with this same terminations
which he employs have now substituted for it <i>er</i>. Such are
<i>reportour</i>, <i>revelour</i>, and <i>riotour</i>. In truth, each
one of the words belonging to the class has a history of its own. But
<i>honor</i> is in most respects typical of them all. Accordingly,
while there is no purpose to neglect the others, upon it the attention
will be mainly fixed.</p>

<p>It was in the fourteenth century that the wholesale irruption of the
French element into our vocabulary took place. But before the great
invasion in which words came into the speech by battalions, single
words had already entered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span> as if to prepare the way. One of these
earlier adventurers was the term under consideration. It made its
appearance in the language as early, at least, as the beginning of
the thirteenth century. Unlike most of its class, its first syllable
demands attention as well as its last. As a foreign word, it naturally
exhibited at its original introduction the forms that belonged to it
in the tongue from which it was derived. There was no prejudice in
those days in favor of a fixed orthography. Each author did what was
right in his own eyes; or perhaps it would be more correct to say,
what was right to his own ears. In the Romance tongues the hostility
to the aspirate, which has animated the hearts of so large a share
of the race, had caused it to be dropped in pronunciation. As a
result, writers being then phonetically inclined, discarded it from
the spelling. Hence, <i>honor</i> presented itself in our language
without the initial <i>h</i>. Its first recorded appearance is in a
work, the manuscript of which is ascribed to the neighborhood of 1200
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> In that it was written <i>onur</i>, just as <i>hour</i>
sometimes appeared as <i>ure</i>. It hardly needs to be said that the
vowel in these cases does not represent the now common sound we call
“short <i>u</i>.”</p>

<p>It is not always easy to discover the motives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span> which influence men in
the choice of spellings. But it is no difficult matter to detect the
reason for the change which here took place. Before the minds of the
writers of this early period was always the Latin original. In that
tongue the word began with <i>h</i>. Derivation is always dear to the
hearts of the scholastically inclined. In those days it was only men
of this class who did any writing at all. Hence, both in Old French
and in Old English, it was not long before the letter <i>h</i> came to
be prefixed regularly to the word. It was not sounded. But it was soon
adopted universally in the spelling, and, once established there, it
never lost its hold. In the case of several other words which have had
essentially the same history, the pronunciation of the aspirate has
been resumed under the influence of the printed page. But <i>honor</i>
is one of four which up to this time have held out unflinchingly
against any such tendency.</p>

<p>So much for the initial letter. As regards the termination, the word
made its appearance in several forms. Only three of them need be
mentioned here, for they were the ones much the most common. These
were <i>honor</i>, <i>honour</i>, <i>honur</i>. The last was the
first to go. It left the field to the other two forms, which have
flourished side by side from that day to this.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span> Were I to trust to the
impressions produced by my own reading, I should say that from the
middle of the fourteenth century to the middle of the sixteenth the
form in <i>our</i> was much the more common. But, in the New Historical
English Dictionary, Dr. Murray asserts distinctly that “<i>honor</i>
and <i>honour</i> continued to be equally frequent down to the
seventeenth century.” One accordingly must defer to the authority of a
generalization which is based upon a much fuller array of facts than it
is in the power of an individual to get together.</p>

<p>By the time we reach the sixteenth century, and especially the
Elizabethan age, it is pretty plain that something of the orthographic
controversy which has been raging ever since had already begun to make
itself heard. The little we know about it we learn from brief remarks
in books, or chance allusions in plays. The discussion, such as it
was, seems to have had little regard to orthoepy, but was based almost
entirely upon considerations of etymology. It was in the sixteenth
century more particularly that derivation began to work havoc with
the spelling. Sometimes it simplified it; full as frequently, if not
more frequently, it perverted what little phonetic character words had
possessed originally or had been enabled to retain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span> For the classical
influence was then at its height. Consequently, a disposition was apt
to manifest itself to go back to the Latin form and insert letters
which had been dropped from the spelling because they had been dropped
from the pronunciation.</p>

<p>It seems inevitable that the etymological bias so prevalent in the
sixteenth century should have exerted some influence, and perhaps a
good deal of influence, in causing a preference to be given by many to
the forms in <i>or</i>. Old French had been forgotten by the community
generally, and met the eyes of lawyers only. Modern French had not then
so much vogue as Italian. But Latin was familiar to every educated man.
It was accordingly natural that the spelling of the words of the class
under consideration should show a tendency to go back to the forms
employed in that tongue. This inference may seem to be borne out by the
few specific data which have been collected. In the case of Shakespeare
the existence of a concordance to his writings enables us to furnish
certain positive statements with comparative ease. Mention has been
made of the fact that in the folio of 1623 the spelling <i>honor</i>
occurs twice as often as <i>honour</i>. Of course, in a work printed
so long after his death, this is no positive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span> evidence as to the
dramatist’s own usage. But whatever preference he felt, it seems right
to infer, was indicated in the two poems published in his lifetime. Of
these the proofs must have passed under his own eye. In <i>The Rape
of Lucrece</i>, which came out in 1594, the word occurs just twenty
times: in seventeen instances it is spelled <i>honor</i>; in three,
<i>honour</i>. In <i>Venus and Adonis</i> it is found but twice. In
both instances <i>honor</i> is the spelling employed.</p>

<p>A generalization, however, based upon isolated facts is always liable
to be misleading. Whatever value attaches to those just given is due
mainly to the eminence of the author. No statement of universal,
or even of common usage can be safely based upon them.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The
examination of other books would in all likelihood show divergence in
many instances from the practice here indicated. Furthermore, we must
not forget that English orthography is not due to scholars or men of
letters, but to typesetters. The spellings found in any book of the
Elizabethan period are as likely to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span> those of the printing-house
as of the author. This, in fact, is not unfrequently true of our own
age. It is likewise clear that these same printing-houses exhibited a
fine impartiality in the use of these terminations. Volume after volume
can be taken up, on different pages of which we can find <i>honor</i>
and <i>honour</i>, <i>humor</i>, and <i>humour</i>, <i>labor</i> and
<i>labour</i>, and so on through the list. In truth, the book would be
an exception where absolute uniformity prevailed.</p>

<p>An interesting example of this variableness of usage may be observed
in the dozen lines in which Shakespeare dedicated, in 1593, his poem
of <i>Venus and Adonis</i> to the Earl of Southampton. The inscription
is to the “Right Honorable Henrie Wriothesley”; the address itself
begins with “Right Honourable.” Throughout these few lines the phrase
“your honor” occurs just three times. Twice it is spelled <i>honor</i>,
once <i>honour</i>. Modern editions entirely ignore this variation of
usage. In every instance they insert the <i>u</i> in the word, thus
giving, as usual, to the modern reader an entirely false impression of
Shakespeare’s practice.</p>

<p>In this matter the only incontrovertible fact to be found is that in
the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries both <i>honor</i>
and <i>honour</i> exist side by side. Which form occurs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span> more
frequently in the period could not be told without an exhaustive
investigation of its whole literature. As a result of my own
necessarily incomplete observation, I should say that from the middle
of the seventeenth century there was a growing sentiment in favor
of the ending <i>our</i> in the majority of dissyllabic words. This
tendency became distinctly stronger after the Restoration. On the other
hand, the disposition to use the form in <i>or</i> became increasingly
prevalent in words of more than two syllables. To both these statements
there are exceptions, perhaps numerous exceptions, especially in the
case of the latter. Individual preferences, too counted for a great
deal in an age when the idolatrous devotion to our present orthography
had not begun to manifest itself. But the statements just given may be
taken as a near approach to the truth, if not the precise truth itself.</p>

<p>Assuredly the tendency to use the forms in <i>our</i> increased in the
latter half of the seventeenth century. This was true in particular of
dissyllabic words. In the years which followed the Restoration it seems
to have become dominant. Such a conclusion is apparently supported
by the dictionaries of the time. Let us go back for evidence to our
title-word. The spelling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span> <i>honour</i> is the only one authorized
in the dictionaries of Phillips, Kersey, Coles, Fenning, and Martin,
which appeared during the latter part of the seventeenth century or
the earlier part of the eighteenth. It has already been mentioned that
before the publication of Doctor Johnson’s, the two leading authorities
were Bailey’s and Dyche and Pardon’s. Of the two, the latter was
probably the less widely used. Bailey gave to these now disputed words
the ending in <i>our</i>. He did not even recognize the existence of
that in <i>or</i>. On the other hand, Dyche, in the case of certain of
them, authorized both forms. He put down, for example, <i>honor</i>
and <i>honour</i>, <i>error</i> and <i>errour</i>, <i>humor</i> and
<i>humour</i>. Furthermore, in each of these instances he gave the
preference to the first. Of course, he was not thorough-going in his
practice. He would have been unfaithful to the national spirit had
he been consistent. Accordingly, in other words of this class, such
as <i>favor</i> and <i>labor</i>, he recognized only the spelling in
<i>our</i>.</p>

<p>But as in every period there are found those who cherish with peculiar
affection whatever is anomalous or incongruous or irrational, and cling
to it through good report and evil report, so there always spring up
a pestilent crowd of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span> men who have an abiding hostility to whatever
displays these characteristics. The attention of certain restless
beings of this sort began to be directed toward this very class of
words. By the middle of the eighteenth century their influence was
making itself felt. A perceptible disposition was manifested to do
away with the irregularities that had come to prevail. It does not
seem to have been based upon any phonetic grounds. It apparently owed
little or nothing to the desire to conform to the Latin original. The
aim seems simply to have been to simplify orthography by reducing
all the words of this class to a uniform termination. At this time
polysyllables belonging to it—the trisyllables being included under
that term—had largely come to drop the <i>u</i>. So had a respectable
number of dissyllables. Why not make the rule universal? Why add to the
difficulty inherent in English orthography the further difficulty of
an arbitrary distinction which serves no useful purpose? No particular
reason seemed to exist why <i>author</i> and <i>error</i> should
be spelled without <i>u</i>, and <i>honor</i> and <i>favor</i> and
<i>color</i> with it. So they argued. The movement for dropping the
vowel made distinct headway; it actually accomplished a good deal,
and might have accomplished everything had it not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span> met the powerful
opposition of Doctor Johnson. In 1755 came out his dictionary. It did
not drive out of circulation other works of the same kind, but it
largely deprived them of authority with the educated. It practically
gained the position of a court of final appeal.</p>

<p>Johnson knew very little about orthoepy and its relation to
orthography; but on account of the deference paid to him, not only by
his contemporaries, who knew nothing whatever about either, but also by
later lexicographers, especially the two most prominent, Sheridan and
Walker, his work is of very great importance for the influence it has
had upon English spelling. Toward most of what he recommended a sort
of religious respect was soon exhibited by many. This attitude may be
said to have characterized for a long time the English people. He set
himself against the processes of simplification that were going on. He
laid down the dictum that the true orthography must always be regarded
as dependent upon the derivation. It must, therefore, be determined by
its immediate original. He did not conform to his own theory; he could
not conform to it. But men accepted his assertions without paying any
special heed to his practice. In consequence, his authority exerted a
distinct influence toward retaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span> many spellings which in his time
were tending to go out of use.</p>

<p>Especially was this true of the words of the class under consideration.
At the time Johnson was engaged in the preparation of his dictionary
the forms in <i>or</i> had come to be in a distinct majority. Usage
was variable, it is true, depending as it did on individual likes or
dislikes. But on the whole a preference was beginning to manifest
itself for the termination <i>or</i>, at least outside of certain
words. Still, it would have been then possible to bring about
uniformity by the adoption of either ending to the exclusion of the
other. From the orthographical point of view of that period, no serious
objection would have been offered by the large majority of men to
that course of action. But such a proceeding would, in the eyes of
many, have been attended with one fatal defect. It would have made
the termination of all the words of this class uniform, and therefore
easy to understand and to master. This would have brought the result
into conflict with the cherished though unavowed ideal we hold, which
is to make the spelling as difficult of acquisition as possible. In
this feeling Johnson himself unconsciously shared. He had to the full
that love of the illogical and anomalous and unreasonable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span> with the
contributing fondness for half-measures, which is so characteristic of
our race as contrasted with the French. This attitude was reflected in
his treatment of this particular class of words. He compromised the
controversy between the two endings in the case of about a hundred
of the most common of them by impartially spelling about half with
<i>or</i> and the other half with <i>our</i>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in regard to the particular class of words under
discussion, both Johnson’s theory and practice must be taken into
consideration. Between these there was wide divergence, and oftentimes
contradiction. In theory he set himself resolutely against the efforts
of those who were seeking to bring about uniformity. He pointed out
that “<i>our</i> is frequently used in the last syllable of words which
in Latin end in <i>or</i>, and are made English as <i>honour</i>,
<i>labour</i>, <i>favour</i>, for <i>honor</i>, <i>labor</i>,
<i>favor</i>.” He then set out to give the reasons for his own choice
of the form he had adopted. “Some late innovators,” he wrote, “have
ejected the <i>u</i>, not considering that the last syllable gives the
sound neither of <i>o</i> nor <i>u</i>, but a sound between them, if
not compounded of both.” The just observation contained in one part of
this sentence is rendered nugatory by the unfounded assertion at the
end and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span> extraordinary conclusion drawn. Johnson’s argument really
amounts to this: Neither <i>o</i> nor <i>u</i> represents the actual
vowel sound heard in the last syllable. In each case there would be
only an approach to it. Therefore, let us not think of employing either
one of the vowels which represent the sound only imperfectly, but a
vowel combination which does not represent it at all.</p>

<p>His cautiously guarded utterance shows that Johnson was vaguely
conscious of the weakness of the position he had taken if not of its
absurdity. Hence, he felt the need of furnishing it additional support.
So he abandoned phonetics and resorted to derivation. He proceeded to
suggest a reason which since his day has played the most important of
parts in all the attempts which have been made to explain the cause of
the retention of <i>our</i> in the spelling of these words. “Besides
that,” he continued, “they are probably derived from the French
nouns in <i>eur</i>, as <i>honeur</i> (<i>sic</i>), <i>faveur</i>.”
Johnson had not that courage of his ignorance which distinguishes
the assertions of later men who employ his argument. He spoke
hesitatingly of the derivation as a probability. As it was erroneous,
this course was wise. His followers, however, from that day to this,
have invariably stated it as a fact. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span> repeated, nevertheless, his
general view in the grammar with which he prefaced the dictionary.
“Some ingenious men,” he remarked, sarcastically, “have endeavored to
deserve well of their country by writing <i>honor</i> and <i>labor</i>
for <i>honour</i> and <i>labour</i>.”</p>

<p>Such was Johnson’s attitude in theory; his action was distinctly
different. Like the rest of us, he was governed entirely by sentiment
working independently of knowledge or reason. He preferred the
spelling, as do we all, which he himself was wont to use. He judged
it to be the proper spelling because he was familiar with it. The
utter lack of any intelligent or even intelligible principle he was
actuated by in his choice can be illustrated by two or three examples.
<i>Anterior</i> was spelled by him with the ending <i>our</i>;
<i>posterior</i> with the ending <i>or</i>. The termination of
<i>interior</i> was <i>our</i>; that of <i>exterior</i> was <i>or</i>.
This is not the reign of law, but of lawlessness. The only explanation
I have been able to devise of the motives, outside of association,
which may have unconsciously led him to adopt the ending he did in
any particular case, was a possible feeling on his part that when
the word denoted the agent it should have the termination <i>or</i>;
but <i>our</i> when it denoted state or condition. This is not a
satisfactory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span> reason for making a difference; but it has a glimmering
of sense. Yet while in general this course is true of Johnson’s
practice, it is, unfortunately, not universally true. <i>Stupor</i> and
<i>torpor</i> appeared, for illustration, in his dictionary without the
<i>u</i>; while on the other hand with it are found <i>ambassadour</i>,
<i>emperour</i>, <i>governour</i>, and <i>warriour</i>.</p>

<p>It is certain that Johnson himself, in the spellings he authorized,
never conformed to the principle of derivation, which he held out to
us as the all-sufficient guide. Several of the words which appear in
his dictionary with the intruding vowel had come to us directly from
the Latin. Accordingly, the form he gave them was in direct defiance
of the principles which he had laid down. Of these <i>candor</i> is so
striking an example that it is worth while to give some account of it
in detail. The word came into our language in the fourteenth century,
but as a pure Latin word. When used in the black-letter period, after
the invention of printing, it appeared in Roman type, to indicate that
it was still a foreigner, just as we now indicate a borrowed term by
italics. In the early seventeenth century it had become naturalized.
Accordingly, it was at first spelled like its original. About the
middle of the seventeenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span> century <i>u</i> was occasionally inserted.
This way of spelling it increased after the Restoration. Necessarily,
such a usage not only defied but disguised the real original. For a
long time the correct and incorrect forms flourished side by side. It
was Johnson’s adoption of the ending <i>our</i> for the word which
fixed this erroneous spelling upon the English people. Men now tell
you with all the intense earnestness of ignorance that <i>candor</i>
should be spelled with a <i>u</i> because it came from a foreign word
which has no direct connection with it whatever. Yet the very same
men who insist upon retaining a <i>u</i> in <i>honor</i>, because, as
they fancy, it was derived from the French <i>honneur</i>, cling just
as tenaciously to the form <i>candour</i>, and will cling to it after
they have learned to know that it was derived directly from the Latin
<i>candor</i>.</p>

<p>Not only, indeed, in his preaching, but in his personal practice,
Johnson may be said to have been inconsistent in his inconsistency. Of
this there is a most singular illustration. In the dictionary itself
<i>author</i> was given as here spelled. Not even a hint was conveyed
of the existence of another form. But in the preface to the dictionary
this same word was employed by him just fourteen times. In every
instance it was spelled <i>authour</i>. Nor could this have been the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
fault of the type-setter. So far was it from exciting remonstrance or
reprehension on his part that the form is not only found in the first
edition of 1755, but also in the fourth edition of 1773, the last which
appeared in his lifetime, and which underwent some slight revision at
his hands. Had Johnson chanced to adopt in the body of the work the
spelling of this word as it appeared in his preface to it, the form
with <i>u</i> would in all probability have continued to maintain
itself. Men would be found at this day to insist that the very safety
of the language depended upon its permanent retention. There would,
indeed, be authors who would fail to recognize themselves as authors
unless this unnecessary <i>u</i> was inserted into the word denoting
their profession.</p>

<p>But though the weight of Johnson’s authority was impaired by his
practice, there is no question that his words did more to prevent
the universal adoption of the ending <i>or</i> than any other single
agency. For that purpose they were timely. There had then begun to be
something of an effort to correct certain of the most striking errors
and inconsistencies of English orthography. With this, Hume, for one,
sympathized. That this assumed enemy of the faith should be favorably
inclined to any movement of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span> the sort, and to some extent should
conform to it, was enough of itself to set Doctor Johnson against it.
That author, in the first edition of his History, had followed what
was then sometimes called the new method of spelling. As regards the
particular class of words here under consideration, he used several
such forms as <i>ardor</i>, <i>flavor</i>, <i>labor</i>, <i>vigor</i>,
and <i>splendor</i>. But Hume had no vital interest in the matter.
His reason told him what was proper and analogical; but he was little
disposed to fight convention on this point. Therefore, he wavered
at intervals between spellings which he recognized as sensible and
those which had the approval of the printing-house and consequently
that of the general public. “I had once an intention of changing the
orthography in some particulars,” he wrote, in 1758, to Strahan, on
the occasion of bringing out a new edition of his History, “but on
reflection I find that this new method of spelling (which is certainly
the best and most conformable to analogy) has been followed in the
quarto volume of my philosophical writings lately published; and,
therefore, I think it will be better for you to continue the spelling
as it is.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>In truth, the moment that Doctor Johnson had set the example of
attacking the pestilent disturbers of orthographic peace, a host of
imitators were sure to follow in his footsteps. One of these was
the physician John Armstrong, who dabbled also, to some extent, in
literature. Among other things, he produced one of those ponderous
poems in which the eighteenth century abounded, and with which the
extremely conscientious student of English literature feels himself
under obligation to struggle. He also tried his hand at a volume of
short <i>Sketches and Essays</i>, as they were called, which came out
anonymously. Among them was one on the <i>Modern Art of Spelling</i>.
In it he attacked with vigor the so-called reformers who were employing
the forms <i>honor</i>, <i>favor</i>, <i>labor</i>. Indeed, he apprised
us—what otherwise we should hardly have known—that there were then
misguided beings who threw out one of the vowels in the termination of
words not belonging strictly to the class we are discussing, and wrote
<i>neighbor</i>, <i>behavior</i>, and <i>endeavur</i>. Armstrong’s
little work appeared in 1757; it might have been written yesterday.
It displays the same misunderstanding and misconception of the whole
subject which characterizes the men of our day, who have the advantage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
of being heirs to the accumulated ignorance of the past. In places,
too, he was as amusing as they. Nothing, he told us, did so much
to distinguish his own “as an <i>unmanly</i> age”—the italics are
his—“as this very aversion to the honest vowel <i>u</i>.”</p>

<p>Hume’s attitude of indifference is manifested in his comments on this
volume. He evidently considered himself as one of the men aimed at in
its animadversions upon the reformers. In June, 1758, he spoke about
the work in a letter to his publisher, Andrew Millar. “I have read,” he
wrote, “a small pamphlet called <i>Sketches</i>, which, from the style,
I take to be Doctor Armstrong’s, though the public voice gives it to
Allan Ramsay. I find the ingenious author, whoever he be, ridicules the
new method of spelling, as he calls it; but that method of spelling
<i>honor</i>, instead of <i>honour</i>, was Lord Bolingbroke’s, Doctor
Middleton’s, and Mr. Pope’s, besides many other eminent writers.
However, to tell truth, I hate to be in any way particular in a
trifle; and, therefore, if Mr. Strahan has not printed off above ten
or twelve sheets, I should not be displeased if you told him to follow
the usual—that is, his own—way of spelling throughout; we shall
make the other volumes conformable to it: if he be advanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span> farther,
there is no great matter.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> This is by no means a solitary instance
of the way in which authors have submitted their own convictions to
the practices of printing-houses and thereby caused this creation of
type-setters we call English orthography, to be an object of reverent
worship to thousands, who contribute large sums to convert those bowing
down to gods of wood and stone.</p>

<p>Great, however, as was Johnson’s authority, there was not paid to it
at the time unquestioning assent. The glaring inconsistency between
his principles and his practice made many indisposed to accept him as
an infallible guide. Dissent came from two quarters. There were those
who accepted fully his views as to the propriety of following the form
of the assumed immediate original. These not unreasonably looked with
disfavor upon his dereliction in the case of many words. Among the
recalcitrants was his devoted disciple Boswell. In 1768 this author
brought out the journal of his tour in Corsica. In the preface to it he
expressed the feelings of many in his comments upon his master’s course
in this matter. “It may be necessary,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span> wrote, “to say something
in defense of my orthography. Of late it has become the fashion to
render our language more neat and trim by leaving out <i>k</i> after
<i>c</i>, and <i>u</i> in the last syllable of words which used to
end in <i>our</i>. The illustrious Mr. Samuel Johnson, who has alone
executed in England what was the task of whole academies in other
countries, has been careful in his dictionary to preserve the <i>k</i>
as a mark of the Saxon original. He has for the most part, too, been
careful to preserve the <i>u</i>, but he has also omitted it in several
words. I have retained the <i>k</i>, and have taken upon me to follow
a general rule with regard to words ending in <i>our</i>. Wherever a
word originally Latin has been transmitted to us through the medium
of the French, I have written it with the characteristic <i>u</i>. An
attention to this may appear trivial. But I own I am one of those who
are curious in the formation of language in its various modes, and
therefore wish that the affinity of English with other tongues may not
be forgotten.”</p>

<p>Boswell resembled most of the ardent partisans of the ending <i>our</i>
in the fact that his curiosity in the formation of language had never
been rewarded by any intelligent knowledge of it. The <i>k</i> was,
in his eyes, a mark of the Saxon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span> original. The only comment that it
is necessary to make upon this assertion is that the letter <i>k</i>
was not in the Anglo-Saxon alphabet any more than it was in the Roman,
from which the former was derived. Hence, as has been already pointed
out, monosyllabic words like <i>back</i>, <i>sack</i>, <i>sick</i>,
<i>thick</i>, in the earliest form of our speech, ended with <i>c</i>;
and if we were really so devoted to derivation as we pretend, we should
have to discard the <i>k</i> from the end of monosyllables, just as we
have from the end of polysyllables. Boswell, however, carried out his
views to their logical conclusion. Johnson might exhibit the weakness
of deferring in particular instances to general custom; not so his
follower and admirer. So we find him running counter to his master’s
teachings by using the spellings <i>authour</i>, <i>doctour</i>,
<i>rectour</i>, <i>taylour</i>, and others among the dissyllables;
and among the polysyllables there were the forms <i>professour</i>,
<i>spectatour</i>, <i>conspiratour</i>, <i>preceptour</i>,
<i>innovatour</i>, <i>legislatour</i>, and a large number that need not
be given here.</p>

<p>It is evident from Boswell’s protest that the disposition to drop
the <i>u</i> had become so prevalent that there was danger of its
prevailing. The aversion was increasing to the use of this very honest
letter, as Armstrong had called it. Johnson’s authority retarded the
progress of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span> tendency, but outside of a certain limited number of
cases did not check it effectually. It was not long before the vowel
was pretty regularly dropped in polysyllabic words. In them it has
remained dropped ever since. Few, indeed, are the persons who can now
be found writing <i>ambassadour</i>, <i>emperour</i>, <i>governour</i>,
<i>oratour</i>, <i>possessour</i>, and no small number of others which
the great lexicographer insisted upon as the proper way. Even some of
his dissyllabic words have gone over to the form in <i>or</i>, notably
those which had <i>rr</i> before the suffix, such as <i>error</i>,
<i>horror</i>, and <i>terror</i>.</p>

<p>No idea of the strength of the movement towards uniformity can be
gathered from the dictionaries of the time. These, as a general rule,
followed Johnson even when the rest of the world was going the other
way. Both Sheridan and Walker stuck to the final <i>k</i> long after
nearly everybody else had given it up. The latter, indeed, deplored
the custom of omitting it because it had introduced into the language
the novelty of ending a word with an unusual letter. This, on the
face of it, he said, was a blemish. Still less did the lexicographers
represent the general attitude of the time towards the class of words
here considered, especially the attitude of aristocratic society.
The fortunes of two of these words, in particular, on account of the
frequency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span> of their appearance on cards of invitation, reached at
this period the highest social elevation. These were <i>honor</i> and
<i>favor</i>. To spell them with a <i>u</i> became and remained for a
long while a distinctive mark of rusticity and ill-breeding—not, as
now, an evidence of imperfect acquaintance with their history.</p>

<p>On this point we have plenty of unimpeachable testimony. The dictionary
of Walker, the leading lexicographer of his own generation and of
the generation following, came out towards the end of the eighteenth
century. In it he gave utterance to his grief on this very subject. His
remarks occur under the word of which, in defiance of general custom,
he continued to authorize the form <i>honour</i>. “This word,” he said,
“and its companion <i>favour</i>, the two servile attendants upon cards
and notes of fashion, have so generally dropped the <i>u</i> that to
spell these words with that letter is looked upon as <i>gauche</i>
and rustick in the extreme. In vain did Dr. Johnson enter his protest
against the innovation; in vain did he tell us that the sound of
the word required the use of <i>u</i>, as well as its derivation
from the Latin through the French: the sentence seems to have been
passed, and we now hardly even find these words with this vowel but in
dictionaries.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>But Walker, though he followed, as in duty bound, his great leader, was
subject to qualms of common sense. These, when they occur, always make
sad work with orthographic prejudices. When he looked at the matter
dispassionately he had to confess that Johnson’s arguments in behalf of
the spellings which he had authorized did not impress him altogether
favorably; in fact, he manifested a sneaking inclination for the forms
without <i>u</i>. “Though,” he said, “I am a declared enemy to all
needless innovation, I see no inconvenience in spelling these words in
the fashionable manner: there is no reason for preserving the <i>u</i>
in <i>honour</i> and <i>favour</i> that does not hold good for the
preservation of the same letter in <i>errour</i>, <i>authour</i>, and
a hundred others; and with respect to the pronunciation of these words
without <i>u</i>, while we have so many words where the <i>o</i> sounds
<i>u</i>, even when the accent is on it, as <i>honey</i>, <i>money</i>,
etc., we need not be in much pain for the sound of <i>u</i>, in words
of this termination, where the final <i>r</i> brings all the accented
vowels to the same level; that is, the short sound of <i>u</i>.”</p>

<p>The fashionable method of spelling these words prevailed for a long
time. The behavior of high society in so doing stirred profoundly the
deep-seated conservatism of the middle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span> class. The great founder of
Methodism warned his followers against this vanity. “Avoid,” wrote
Wesley, in 1791, “the fashionable impropriety of leaving out the
<i>u</i> in many words, as <i>honor</i>, <i>vigor</i>, etc. This is
mere childish affectation.” Remarks of this sort availed nothing—at
least, they did not affect the right persons. The aristocratic world
cared little for the woes of lexicographers or the denunciations of
religious leaders. As is its wont, it went on in its usual heartless
way, paying no heed whatever to the remonstrances directed against its
conduct in this matter.</p>

<p>The practice seems to have continued during the first third, at least,
of the nineteenth century. As late as 1832 Archdeacon Hare denounced it
in the Philological Museum. Hare was, in his way, a spelling-reformer,
and drew upon himself much obloquy for the orthographical peculiarities
he adopted. He furnished us himself with some specimens of the
sort of objections which were raised to his efforts. As might be
expected, they were made up of the same old combination of virulence
and ignorance with which we are all familiar. In the eyes of one,
change of spelling was a piece of impudent presumption. In the eyes
of another, it was a piece of silly affectation. Or, again, it was
a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span> mistaking of singularity for originality, a waste upon trifles of
attention which ought to be reserved for matters of real importance.
What surprises us now is that so much excitement should have been
provoked by alterations so petty; for all of any importance that Hare
proposed was spelling the participial ending <i>ed</i> as <i>t</i>
when it had the sound of <i>t</i>. Thus, we find in his writings
<i>reacht</i>, <i>vanquisht</i>, <i>pickt</i>, <i>supprest</i>,
<i>rusht</i>, <i>publisht</i>, and no small number of similar forms.
These he defended, as it was easy to do, by the usage of Spenser and
Milton and their contemporaries—even, indeed, from the practice of
the comic dramatists who followed the Restoration period, such as
Congreve, Vanbrugh, and Farquhar. That petty changes of this nature
should have been regarded by educated men as serious innovations shows
how all-extensive had become with them the ignorance of the history of
their own tongue.</p>

<p>Hare’s countrymen ought, indeed, to have been reassured by his other
spellings that there was no danger of immediate ruin to the language
by any innovations he might be supposed to favor. The truth is that he
knew almost as little of the real principles governing orthography and
talked of them nearly as much as did his friend and fellow-reformer,
Walter Savage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span> Landor. But however perverse were his vagaries in other
matters, upon the class of words ending in <i>or</i> or <i>our</i> he
was, unlike Landor, eminently sound. Indeed, he was more than sound. He
reintroduced the <i>u</i> into some words of this class where it had
at one time often appeared but had then become generally discarded. He
trotted out, as was in those days almost inevitable, the old bugaboo
of derivation, as unconscious of its erroneousness, scholar as he
was, as are now the most unscholarly who persist in obtruding it upon
a generation which knows better. “If,” he wrote, “<i>honour</i>,
<i>favour</i>, and other similar words had come to us directly from the
Latin, it might be better to spell them without a <i>u</i>; but since
we got them through the French, so that they brought the <i>u</i> with
them when they landed on our shores, it will be well to leave such
affectations as <i>honor</i> and <i>favor</i> to the great vulgar for
their cards of invitation.”</p>

<p>The concluding sentence of this quotation shows conclusively that
with people of high position—“the great vulgar,” as Hare calls
them—fashion at the close of the first third of the last century
still dictated the use of the spellings <i>honor</i> and <i>favor</i>.
Herein Hare was opposed to his fellow-reformer Landor. “We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span> differ,”
says the latter, “on the spelling of <i>honour</i>, <i>favour</i>,
etc. You would retain the <i>u</i>; I would eject it for the sake
of consistency.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> If Landor can be trusted to have given a
faithful picture of contemporary practice, this method of spelling
must have continued for at least a score of years after the date
already given. In 1846 came out the third edition of his <i>Imaginary
Conversations</i>. To the dialogue on language which is represented
as having taken place between Doctor Johnson and John Horne Tooke, he
added then a number of passages. Among them was the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Tooke.</i> Would there be any impropriety or inconvenience in
writing <i>endevor</i> and <i>demeanor</i>, as we write <i>tenor</i>,
without the <i>u</i>?</p>

<p><i>Johnson.</i> Then you would imitate cards of invitation, where we
find <i>favor</i> and <i>honor</i>.</p>

<p><i>Tooke.</i> We find <i>ancestor</i> and <i>author</i> and
<i>editor</i> and <i>inventor</i> in the works of Dr. Johnson, who
certainly bears no resemblance to a card of invitation. Why can we not
place all these words on the same bench?</p>
</div>

<p>But fashion comes and goes, while the dictionaries are ever present.
As a rule, lexicographers are a timid race of men. They have little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
disposition to deviate from the paths marked out by their predecessors.
Even the revision of Dyche’s work, which appeared toward the end of
the eighteenth century, discarded his alternative use of <i>honor</i>,
to which it had once given the first place, though at the time itself
this usage had become fashionable. So far as I have observed, the
only eighteenth-century lexicographer after Johnson who fell in with
the current tendency was Ash, whose dictionary first appeared in
1775. He entered separately the two forms of these words, giving, for
illustration, <i>honor</i>, <i>color</i>, and <i>labor</i> as “the
modern and correct spelling,” and <i>honour</i>, <i>colour</i>, and
<i>labour</i> as “the old and usual spelling.” But his action availed
little against the agreement of the others; for apparently, with this
exception, the dictionaries stood their ground manfully. Their combined
authority had necessarily a good deal of effect upon the general
practice, especially with that numerous class of men who did not feel
themselves familiar enough with the subject to act independently.</p>

<p>At a still later period international prejudice came in to strengthen
the disposition in England to stand by the letter <i>u</i> in the
comparatively few cases in which it had continued to survive. In
America, Webster had thrown out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span> the vowel in all words of this class.
In so doing he was followed, half apologetically, by Worcester. Their
agreement had the effect of making the practice of dispensing with the
<i>u</i> almost universal in this country. One singular result of it
was that in time the termination in <i>or</i> instead of <i>our</i>
came to be considered an American innovation. To this very day the
delusion prevails widely on both sides of the Atlantic that the form
of a word which entered the language more than two centuries before
America was discovered, which has been in more or less use in every
century since its introduction, owed its existence to an American
lexicographer. Naturally this was enough to condemn it in the eyes of
any self-respecting Englishman. The belief just mentioned has been a
very real though unacknowledged reason for retaining in that country
the termination in <i>our</i>. Have we not been told again and again in
countless English periodicals—quarterlies, monthlies, weeklies—that
Britons will never, never tolerate any such hideous monstrosity as the
American spelling, <i>honor</i>?</p>

<p>But whatever may have been the causes which brought about, or concurred
to bring about, the reaction in this matter which took place in Great
Britain, there is no question whatever as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span> to the fact. The tendency,
once prevalent and steadily increasing, to drop the <i>u</i> from
all the words of this class, as they had been dropped from most, was
effectually arrested. Even the lexicographers who could see no sense in
the maintenance of this inconsistency in the spelling accepted it while
they deplored it. After the passing of Walker, Smart’s remodelling
of his dictionary became, in the middle of the nineteenth century,
the leading orthographic authority in use in England. The reviser
recognized the absurdity of the disagreement which prevailed in the
spelling of this class of words. Still, he saw no way of remedying
it. In describing his method of dealing with them, he remarked that
he might have followed Webster’s course, and adopted throughout the
termination <i>or</i>. This clearly struck him as sensible, but he as
clearly felt that it would never do. “Such, however,” he wrote, “is
not the practice of the day, though some years ago there was a great
tendency towards it.” For in the meantime a peculiar regard for these
exceptions to the general rule had sprung up among the orthographically
uneducated, a class to which most educated men belong. These exceptions
were not very numerous. They were all dissyllabic words; for the
retention of the <i>u</i> in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span> the polysyllables was too much for even
the Anglo-Saxon love of the anomalous. Still, for the comparatively
few exceptions which had been saved from the general wreck which had
overtaken the <i>our</i> forms, there had begun to display itself
that peculiar enthusiastic zeal which always prevails when devotion
defies reason. No one assuredly can maintain that the latter quality
exists in an orthography which insists upon inserting a <i>u</i> into
<i>honor</i> and withholding it from <i>horror</i>.</p>

<p>A few more than thirty words in common use have partially outlived
the revolution that has brought the vast majority to the termination
in <i>or</i>. They constitute, in consequence, a limited body of
exceptions to the general rule. As in every case the spelling of the
particular word must be learned by itself, they together contribute
an additional perplexity to the existing perplexities of English
orthography. In certain cases they are enabled to interpose a further
obstacle in the path of the learner. When he comes to the derivatives
of several of them which are spelled in <i>our</i> he is called upon
to master exceptions to the exceptions. In order to save the language
from ruin, he is assured that he must be careful to insert a <i>u</i>
in <i>clamor</i>; but when it comes to <i>clamorous</i>, he must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
equally careful to leave the <i>u</i> out. The same sort of statement
can be made of several other words of this same class. We can pardon
<i>laborious</i> from <i>labour</i>. But what excuse can be offered for
writing <i>humour</i> and then <i>humorous</i>, <i>odour</i> and then
<i>odorous</i>, <i>rancour</i> and then <i>rancorous</i>, <i>rigour</i>
and then <i>rigorous</i>, <i>valour</i> and then <i>valorous</i>,
<i>vigour</i> and then <i>vigorous</i>? Yet this business of making a
still more inextricable muddle out of the already muddled condition of
English spelling is held up to us as something essential to the purity
and perfection of English speech.</p>

<p>It is assumptions of this sort that are irritating. In an orthography
where so much is lawless, there is no need of becoming excited over
some particular one of its numerous vagaries. What is offensive in
the spelling of <i>honor</i> as <i>honour</i> is not the termination
itself, but the reasons paraded for its adoption. A man can cling to
the form with <i>u</i> because he has been taught so to spell it,
because by constant association he has come to prefer it. To this there
may be no objection. But there is distinct objection to his implying,
and sometimes asserting, that in so spelling the word he is upholding
the purity of the speech. This is to give to his perhaps excusable
ignorance the quality of inexcusable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span> impudence. His fancied linguistic
virtue is based upon fallacious assumptions which are themselves based
upon facts that are false.</p>

<p>Even were the facts true, they would not justify what is inferred
from them. The argument for insisting upon the ending <i>our</i>,
drawn from derivation, might seem to have been fully disposed of in
the account of the introduction of this word into English, and of the
various forms which it then assumed. But, in spite of the poet, it is
error, not truth, which crushed to earth rises again. Men, presumably
of intelligence, continue still to repeat the assertion that the
word should be spelled <i>honour</i> because it came from the French
<i>honneur</i>. The proclaimers of this view seem honestly to think
that the lives of all of us would be irremediably saddened did not the
presence of the <i>u</i> in this particular English word remind us of
its assumed French original; though the absence of the <i>u</i> in no
small number of words with the same termination, and having essentially
the same history, does not seem to cause in any of us etymological
depression of spirit. But even in this instance deference to derivation
manifestly does not go far enough. If we are to write <i>honour</i>
because it came from the French <i>honneur</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span> what excuse can be
offered for omitting the <i>e</i>? Even more, what excuse can be
offered for omitting one of the two <i>n’s</i>? Assuredly there is no
sacredness belonging to the vowel which does not attach also to the
consonant. The happiness of the devotee of derivation would be still
further enhanced by spelling the word <i>honnour</i>; in fact, in the
sixteenth century this was occasionally done.</p>

<p>The real objection, however, to this particular argument for the
spelling <i>honour</i> is that it has not a particle of truth in it.
It is based entirely upon complete ignorance of the facts. Neither
<i>honor</i> nor <i>honour</i> was derived from <i>honneur</i>. It
is doubtful if that French form existed when <i>honor</i> came into
the English language. However that may be, such was not the form in
Anglo-French from which the English word descended. In that it was
sometimes spelled <i>honor</i>. From it so spelled came our one modern
form. In that again it was sometimes spelled <i>honour</i>. From it so
spelled came our other modern form. The English word had, therefore, a
history independent of the French. Its development took place not on
the same but on a parallel line. Under these circumstances there is
something peculiarly ridiculous in the assertion so constantly made,
that if the <i>u</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span> were dropped from <i>honor</i>, the history of
the word would be lost.</p>

<p>There still remains to be noticed an objection—the utmost strength
of the human imagination cannot well term it an argument—which has
been raised against the spelling in <i>or</i> in such words as have
succeeded to a certain extent in retaining the <i>u</i>. It is that
a change of this sort is certain in some undefined way to ruin the
nobler sentiments of the soul. It is conceded that the <i>u</i>
contributes nothing to the pronunciation of the word, but it conduces
to the edification and spiritual elevation of him who is particular
to insert it. It is intimated by such as take this view that it is
not those who belong to the cold, proud world who could share in this
sentiment or rather sentimentality. Still less would it weigh with
those mechanical utilitarians who think it enough to be guided in their
spelling by sense and reason. To them no ray of the divine rapture
has been imparted which transports the heart of him who finds his
whole nature expand at the presence of a <i>u</i> in <i>honor</i> and
<i>favor</i> and chilled by its absence. Let no one fancy that this
sort of objection is too ridiculous to be advanced seriously. There has
not been a discussion of spelling reform in modern times in which it
has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span> not been brought forward. In the case of those who have taken part
in the latest controversy, I have already expressed my unwillingness
to employ that severest form of personal attack which consists in
citing their own words. I shall accordingly confine myself here to
some remarks of this sort which were made more than a quarter of a
century ago. In 1873 a controversy was going on in England as to the
proper way of spelling the <i>or</i>, <i>our</i> class of words. In the
course of it a correspondent sent to the periodical entitled <i>Notes
and Queries</i> a communication which contained the following exalted
sentiments:</p>

<p>“I think that <i>honour</i> has a more noble and <i>favour</i> a more
obliging look than <i>honor</i> and <i>favor</i>. <i>Honor</i> seems to
me to do just his duty and nothing more; <i>favor</i> to qualify his
kind deed with an air of coldness. <i>Odor</i>, again, may be a fit
term for a chemical distillation; but a whole May garden comes before
me in the word <i>odour</i>.”</p>

<p>The lover of the classics must always feel a sense of regret that
Cicero and Virgil and Horace were denied by the spelling prevailing in
their tongue the opportunity of enjoying this May garden, so cheaply
secured for this sentimental Englishman by spelling <i>odor</i> with a
<i>u</i>. It is always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span> unfortunate when the sense of largeness of soul
can only be developed at the expense of intellect. Fanciful notions
like the one just cited can never be dispelled by argument, as reason
plays no part in bringing them into being. As to association alone
they owe their creation, so to association alone will they owe their
destruction.</p>

<p>He who has taken the pains to master the details given in the chapter
on English sounds and the signs which are intended to represent them,
will have received some conception of the nature of the orthographic
slough in which we are wallowing, and also of the difficulty which
exists of getting out of it. He will recognize that the obstacles which
stand in the way of the reform of English spelling are not merely
greater in number but are harder to overcome than those which beset any
other cultivated tongue of modern Europe. Incomplete as is the survey,
it is a melancholy picture which it presents. To him who has not become
so accustomed to disorder that he has learned to love it for its own
sake, the view is distinctly disheartening. The present orthography
fulfills neither its legitimate office of denoting pronunciation nor
its illegitimate one of disclosing derivation. It is consistent only
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span> inconsistency. It is not necessary for us to consider here how
this state of things came about. It is enough to know that it exists.
A thorough-going reform of English orthography would therefore be one
of the most gigantic of enterprises, even if men were fully informed
about it and their hearts were set upon it. But a distinct majority of
the educated class, though not educated on this subject, are opposed to
it. Naturally the profounder their ignorance, the more intense is their
hostility. It is no wonder, therefore, that many, in contemplating this
dead-weight of prejudice that must be unloaded, have come to despair of
the language ever being relieved in the slightest of the burden.</p>

<p>Let it be assumed, however, for the sake of the argument, that a
general agreement exists that a reform of some kind is regarded not
merely as desirable, but as practicable. At once arises the question:
What shall be its nature? How far shall it be carried? Two courses
are clearly open. One is to make a thorough-going reform of English
orthography in order to have it accord with a genuine phonetic ideal,
so that when a man sees a word he will know how to pronounce it, and
when he hears a word he will know how to spell it. Then harmony between
orthography and orthoepy will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span> complete. Now there is certainly
nothing either irrational or of itself offensive in the idea, whatever
opinion we may hold as to the practicability or desirability of its
attainment. Were we starting out to create a brand-new language, it is
not likely that any one would be found wrong-headed or muddle-headed
enough to look upon such an aim as improper or unwise. But conceding
this ideal to be incapable of realization in the present state of
public opinion, there is presented to our consideration the other
course. This is to reduce the existing anomalies in our spelling,
serving no use and displaying no sense, to the lowest possible number;
to discard from words their unneeded and misleading letters; to bring
all the words of the same general class under the operation of phonetic
law, so as to produce uniformity where an unintelligible diversity now
prevails. These are distinct objects. They constitute two separate
movements which may be characterized by a slight difference in the
wording. One is reform <i>of</i> English orthography; the other is
reform <i>in</i> English orthography.</p>

<p>There have been in the past, and are likely to be in the future, many
attempts at solving the perplexing problems involved in the furtherance
of the first of these two movements.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span> Some of them have been logical
and consistent throughout. But one difficulty there is which has
stood in the way of their acceptance. It will for a long time to come
stand in the way. They must necessarily be addressed to generations
which have not even an elementary conception of what the sounds of
the language are, what are their real values, and what is the proper
way of representing these values. As language is now learned full as
much by the eye as by the ear, if not, indeed, more so, the form of
the word as it is spelled, not as it is pronounced, becomes what is
associated in the common mind with the word itself. In modern times
this has begot an unreasoning devotion. Accordingly, as difference in
a hitherto unheard method of pronunciation has always affected men by
the mere sound of it, so does now a new spelling affect them by the
sight of it. It arrests the attention of all. Of some it excites the
resentment; to others it almost causes convulsions of agony. Hence,
those who advocate a pure phonetic spelling—in itself the only
strictly rational method—are holding forth a counsel of perfection
to a body of persons who are so steeped in orthographic iniquity that
they have come to think it the natural condition of the race. This is a
situation which has to be recognized.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span> Therefore, in the present state
of public opinion, largely unintelligent and hostile in proportion to
its lack of intelligence, it seems to me that reform <i>of</i> English
orthography—using the distinction just made—is not practicable. We
must content ourselves with reform <i>in</i> English orthography,
imperfect and unsatisfactory in many particulars as it necessarily
must be. Still, the middling possible is better than the ideally
unattainable.</p>

<p>In a certain sense the latter course is, or ought to be, included in
the former. Any reform <i>in</i> English orthography which conflicts
with the ideal of reform <i>of</i> English orthography is not really
a reform at all. It is nothing more than a temporary makeshift which
puts an obstacle in the way of proper future effort. A piecemeal
restoration of anything which is not in full conformity with the
just restoration of the whole will do more than leave something to
be desired. It will introduce much to be deprecated. Any process of
simplification in a language whose spelling is so inherently vicious
as ours is sure to be attended with inconsistencies. In any partial
reform there will always arise exceptions which can never be swept away
until that thorough-going reform is made for which the public mind is
not prepared. These exceptions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span> will be seized upon and triumphantly
paraded by the opponents of change as proof that as the reform proposed
cannot be made perfect at once, it ought not to be begun at all. There
would be truth in the last contention if the alterations recommended
were not, as far as they go, in full conformity with that phonetic
ideal which, though we shall never reach, we ought always to keep
in view. The one essential thing to be insisted upon in the reform
<i>in</i> English orthography is that it shall follow the path of
reform <i>of</i> English orthography, no matter how far it may lag
behind it. There should be no resort to temporary expedients which
result in bringing out about a mere external uniformity at the cost
of sacrificing the principle that the spelling should represent the
sound. Furthermore, it must not bow down to the false god of derivation
when such a course brings the form of the word into conflict with its
pronunciation.</p>

<p>Much, indeed, of the discredit and ill success which have attended
previous efforts in behalf of spelling reform have been due to the
imperfect knowledge and erroneous action of those who have undertaken
them. They saw that there was an evil; they did not see what the nature
of the evil was. Hence, they adopted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span> wrong methods of relief. They did
not propose their half-measures as preparations for something better.
They looked upon them as final in themselves. It need hardly be said
that reform of this particular kind could never be pressed consciously
as reform until after uniformity of spelling had practically been
established. Consequently, changes <i>in</i> orthography, as
distinguished from change <i>of</i> orthography, can hardly be said
to go back to an early period. Nearly all noteworthy attempts of the
sort took place in the latter half of the eighteenth century or the
former half of the nineteenth. Johnson’s method of spelling was felt,
especially in the earlier of these two periods, more than it was later,
as a tyranny. It was still so new that all had not become used to it,
and none had learned to love it with the gushing affection of our time.
Many there were who still remembered the former state of freedom. A
few were found who sought to set up rival thrones of their own. The
crotchets, moreover, in which individual writers indulged have been
numberless. In the vast majority of cases the changes proposed by them
have been based upon no scientific principles. Still less have they
been the product of any thoroughly worked-out theory. Accordingly,
they have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span> served little other purpose than to arrest momentarily the
attention of the curious, and have had absolutely no influence whatever
upon the orthography generally received.</p>

<p>In truth, many of these attempts at reform have been worse than
partial. They have been merely in the direction of a mechanical
uniformity which was not based in the slightest upon the nature of
things. One illustration of this effort to bring about change which was
not improvement can be found in the alterations proposed at the end of
the eighteenth century by Joseph Ritson. To scholars Ritson is well
known as the fiercest of antiquaries, who loved accuracy with the same
passion with which other men love persons, and who hated a mistake,
whether arising from ignorance or inadvertence, as a saint might hate
a deliberate lie. He is equally well known for his devotion to a
vegetable diet, and also for the manifestation, noticeable in others
so addicted, of a bloodthirstiness of disposition in his criticism
which the most savage of carnivorous feeders might have contemplated
with envy. The alterations he proposed and carried out in his
published works tended in certain ways toward formal regularity; but
they also tended to make the divergence between the spelling and the
pronunciation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span> still wider. For instance, the so-called regular verb
in our tongue adds ed to form the preterite. Ritson made the general
rule universal. He appended the termination also to verbs ending in
<i>e</i>. Accordingly the past tense, for illustration, of <i>love</i>,
<i>oblige</i>, and <i>surprise</i> appeared as <i>loveed</i>,
<i>obligeed</i>, and <i>surpriseed</i>. As nobody pronounces the one
<i>e</i> which already exists in these preterites, the insertion of
another unnecessary letter could have only the effect of adding an
extra weight to the burden which these unfortunate words were carrying
as it was.</p>

<p>There were other changes proposed by Ritson. None were so bad as this,
but they were all valueless. He himself, however, was too thoroughly
honest a man to pretend that he had arrived at any knowledge of the
principles which underlie the reconstruction of our orthography. He
appears at last to have lost all confidence in his own alterations.
Under his influence his nephew had also been affected with the fever of
reform, and spelled many words in a way different from that commonly
followed. In a letter written in 1795, Ritson informed his kinsman
that he—the latter—was entirely ignorant of the principles both of
orthography and of punctuation, and rather wished to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span> singular than
studied to be right. “For my part,” he added, “I am as little fitted
for a master as you are for a scholar.”</p>

<p>Such changes as those of Ritson provoked amusement rather than
opposition. The knowledge of them, indeed, hardly came to the ears of
those devoted but never very well-informed idolaters of the existing
orthography who feel that the future of the English language and
literature depends upon its present spelling, and that the preservation
of that spelling in its purity, or, rather, in its impurity, rests
largely upon them. They did not attack Ritson’s views, because they
never heard of them. The changes, again, were too unscientific in their
nature to be worthy of serious consideration by him who had the least
comprehension of the real difficulties under which our orthography
labors. Ritson himself lived long enough not only to doubt the value
of his own efforts, but to see that these efforts had been attended
by positive pecuniary disadvantage to himself. The worship of the
orthographical fetish was then well under way. In a letter to Walter
Scott, written in 1803, Ritson told him that his publishers, the
Longmans, thought that the orthography made use of in his <i>Life of
King Arthur</i> had been unfavorable to its sale. Yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span> this was a work
addressed to a class of persons who might be presumed to be peculiarly
free from prejudices which affect so powerfully the semi-educated.
Such a fact speaks stronger than volumes of dissertations as to the
opposition which reform of spelling must overcome before it can meet
with any sort of consideration at the hands of many.</p>

<p>But of these partial reforms, it is the one proposed by Webster that
is most familiar to Americans, and perhaps to all English-speaking
readers; for the storm which it raised was violent enough at one time
to be felt in every land where our tongue was employed. Nor, indeed,
has it so completely subsided that occasional mutterings of it are
not even yet heard. The Websterian orthography, it is to be remarked,
is found only in its primitive, unadulterated purity in the edition
of 1828. All the dictionaries bearing other dates than that must be
neglected by him who seeks to penetrate to the very well-head of this
movement; for the author himself, or his revisers for him, bent before
the orthographic gale, and silently struck out in later editions every
method of spelling which the popular palate could not be brought to
endure or inserted everything which it earnestly craved. No more than
those who preceded him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span> did Webster go to work upon correct principles,
even when looked at from the point of view of a partial reform. One
main defect pervading his plan was that it was an effort to alter
the orthography partly according to analogy and partly according to
derivation. He could not well do both, for they often conflicted.
Furthermore, he was often not consistent in the one and very often not
correct in the other.</p>

<p>As far back as 1806 Webster had published an octavo dictionary of
the English language. From that time for the next twenty years his
attention was mainly directed to the compilation of such a work on a
large scale. He soon found it necessary, he tells us, to discard the
etymological investigations of his predecessors as being insufficient
and untrustworthy. This they largely were, without doubt; but by way
of remedying the defect, Webster devoted years to getting up a series
of derivations which were more insufficient and untrustworthy still.
In the process of doing this he made a study of some twenty languages,
and formed a synopsis of the principal words in these, arranged in
classes under their primary elements or letters. The results of this
study were embodied in the dictionary of 1828, and the orthography was
occasionally made to conform to it. Webster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span> took a serene satisfaction
in these new spellings; but it was upon his etymology that he prided
himself. In his view, it furnished a revelation of the hidden mysteries
of language and a solution of the problem of its origin. With his
eyes intently fixed upon the tower of Babel, he probably never felt
so happy as when he fancied that he had come upon the trace of some
English word found in the tongues made use of in the courts of Nimrod
or Chedorlaomer.</p>

<p>It is a hard thing to say of a work which has taken up no small part
of the lifetime of an earnest student that it is of little value;
but there is not the slightest doubt that nearly all of Webster’s
supposed philological discoveries were the merest rubbish. Necessarily,
inferences based upon them in regard to the proper method of spelling
are utterly unworthy of respect. The derivation, indeed, had at last
to follow the fate which had overtaken certain portions of the new
orthography. Its retention was a little too much for later revisers of
the dictionary. These, in the edition of 1864, swept away at one fell
swoop into the limbo of forgettable and forgotten things the fruits of
twenty years of etymological study. Those conclusions, which in the
eyes of the author had given him the key to unlock the hidden secrets
of language, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span> no longer allowed to appear on the pages of the very
work which perpetuates his name.</p>

<p>The changes of another sort, based upon analogy, which Webster
introduced with the idea of making the spelling of words uniform,
were liable to little positive objection. Some of them, in spite of
violent opposition, have in this country more than held their own.
The consequence is that in the case of a number of words in common
use we have two methods of spelling flourishing side by side. This
is a state of things which, it seems to me, every one who has the
reform of our orthography at heart must contemplate with unqualified
satisfaction. Not that Webster’s proposed changes, even had they been
universally adopted, would have gone to the real root of the evil. Far
from it. At best they merely touch the surface and then only in a few
places. But one effect they have produced. They have in some measure
prevented us, and do still prevent us, from falling to the dead level
of an unreasoning uniformity. By bringing before us two methods of
spelling, they keep open the legitimacy of each. They expose to every
unprejudiced investigator the utter shallowness of the arguments that
are directed against change.</p>

<p>But slight as Webster’s alterations were, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span> met with the bitterest
hostility at the time of their introduction. The love of little things
is deeply implanted in the human mind. It is, therefore, perhaps
not unnatural that the minor changes in spelling which he proposed
should have met with attack far more violent than that directed
against his tremendous etymological speculations. This culminated on
the publication of Worcester’s Dictionary, which in the matter of
orthography followed a more conservative course. A wordy war arose,
which lasted for years. Combatants from every quarter leaped at once
into the arena. They were easily equipped for the contest, inasmuch as
virulence was the main thing required. Intellect was not essential to
the discussion, and knowledge would have been a death-blow to it. The
war of the dictionaries, as it was called, is therefore of interest to
us at this point of time, not for any principle involved in it, but as
an illustration, pertinent at the present moment, of how earnestly,
and even furiously, men can be got to fight for a cause they do not
understand.</p>

<p>There is no doubt, indeed, that Webster laid himself open to attack.
Perfect consistency is not to be looked for in this world; but the
man who sets out to make a reform <i>in</i> English orthography as
contrasted with a reform <i>of</i> English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span> orthography cannot help
being inconsistent. He will feel obliged to retain objectionable
spellings. He will even feel obliged to authorize some that are
inconsistent with his own principles, for the same reason that Moses
tolerated divorce. It is the hardness of men’s hearts, clinging to
ancient abuses and unwilling to break up old associations, which will
force the reformer to accept what he does not approve. Inadvertence,
too, will add failures of its own to the contradictions involved in the
very incompleteness of the scheme which has been adopted.</p>

<p>Both in respect to analogy and derivation, Webster did not carry out
the principles he avowed. There were whole classes of words which
he hesitated to change; at least, he did not change them. Of these
half-measures, whether due to oversight or to doubt, one illustration
will suffice. No man who seeks to make orthography etymologically
uniform can have failed to notice the difference of spelling in the
case of words derived from the compounds of the Latin <i>cedo</i>.
Three end in <i>eed</i>, six in <i>ede</i>. As the digraph <i>ee</i>
has practically the same sound always, the former termination seems
to me preferable. But laying aside personal opinions in the matter,
what sensible reason can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span> given for writing <i>succeed</i> with
<i>ceed</i> and <i>secede</i> with <i>cede</i>? Here was a glaring
anomaly which could hardly have failed to escape Webster’s attention.
If the principle of analogy met with any consideration, this demanded
to be removed, if anything did. But he was unequal to the occasion.
In the edition of 1828 he spelled <i>exceed</i> with <i>ceed</i> and
<i>accede</i> with <i>cede</i>, which every one does, to be sure, but
which he personally had no business to do. In conformity with his
avowed views, he was bound to make uniform the orthography of all the
words which come from the Latin <i>cedo</i>. As he failed to do this,
he subjected himself to the reproach of not having acted in accordance
with his own principles.</p>

<p>The truth is that analogical spelling occupied a very subordinate
position in Webster’s mind. His work is mainly deserving of notice
because, unaided, he chanced in some cases to secure success in spite
of virulent opposition. Its chief value, indeed, lies in the fact that
it has kept alive a feeling of hostility to the existing orthography
of the English tongue; that it has saved many from paying a silly
and slavish deference to the opinions of a not very well-informed
lexicographer of the eighteenth century and his successors; that in the
matter of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span> spelling it has inculcated the belief that there is a test
of reason and scholarship to be applied, and not a mere prescription
based upon ignorance; and that by these means it has given to some a
hope, to others a fear, to all a warning, that however long Philistia
may cling to her idols, they will be broken at last.</p>

<p>It would be a great mistake, however, to assume that the feeling about
the wretched condition of English orthography has been confined to
professional reformers. From almost the very beginning the users of
written speech have been conscious of the burden they were carrying.
It has certainly lain heavily upon the hearts of many thinking men in
the past, and unconsciously, perhaps, on the hearts of all. But this
feeling has never been translated into successful action. In truth,
men believed themselves hopelessly entangled in a network of anomalies
and absurdities which hampered all intelligent proceeding. Out of it
they saw no way of escape. This despairing attitude is plainly apparent
in the comments of the dramatist Ben Jonson on what he terms our
pseudography. In speaking of the digraph <i>ck</i> in certain words,
he remarked that it “were better written without the <i>c</i>, if that
which we have received for orthography would yet be contented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span> to be
altered. But that is an emendation rather to be wished than hoped for,
after so long a reign of ill custom amongst us.”</p>

<p>Consent to be altered, the language never did voluntarily. There
is nothing more absolutely false than the assertion sometimes made
that it has been and still is slowly but steadily reforming the
spelling of its own initiative. Of the usage of the past it requires
peculiar ignorance—though of that the supply is unlimited—to
make an assertion of this sort. Everything of the little which has
been accomplished in the way of reform has been gained only after
a bitter contest. Undoubtedly there has been a steady tendency to
give exclusive recognition to one out of several spellings of a
word and thereby produce absolute uniformity. But there has been no
disposition to make the spelling better. Not infrequently the worst
form has been selected. Any one who takes the trouble to compare the
orthography of the seventeenth century with that now prevailing will
have frequent occasion to observe how slight has been the tendency
toward simplification; that when a choice has lain between different
spellings, it is not unusual to have the more unsuitable one preferred;
and that, as a consequence, the divergence between orthography<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span> and
orthoepy has increased instead of diminishing.</p>

<p>In truth, in this matter we have often gone back not merely from
the practice of the seventeenth century, but from the more rigid
practice of the eighteenth. In the second half of the latter period
Johnson’s Dictionary settled the standard. The changes which have
taken place since his time have all been haphazard. They have been
sometimes for the better; they have as frequently been for the
worse. Take, for illustration, <i>catcall</i>, <i>downfall</i>,
<i>downhill</i>, <i>bethrall</i>, <i>miscall</i>, <i>overfall</i>,
<i>unroll</i>, <i>forestall</i>. In Johnson’s Dictionary these appear
as <i>catcal</i>, <i>downfal</i>, <i>downhil</i>, <i>bethral</i>,
<i>miscal</i>, <i>overfal</i>, <i>unrol</i>, and <i>forestal</i>. As
might be expected, there was no consistency in his treatment of the
terminations found in these words. While he spelled <i>downhil</i>
with a single <i>l</i>, he spelled <i>uphill</i> with two. While he
spelled <i>install</i> with two <i>l’s</i>, he spelled <i>reinstal</i>
with but one. Contradictory usages of this sort are liable to turn
up anywhere in his work. <i>Reconcilable</i>, for instance, appears
in it with an <i>e</i> after the <i>il</i>; <i>irreconcilable</i>
without this vowel. Naturally, arbitrariness of spelling of such a
sort tended much more to the complication of orthography than to its
simplification. There was sufficient love of uniformity in our nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
to reduce many of these variations to one form; but as a general rule
the form selected has been the one which carried the largest number
of unnecessary letters. Take, for instance, the word <i>fulness</i>,
so spelled by Johnson. It is now often written <i>fullness</i>, after
the analogy of <i>illness</i> and <i>smallness</i>. But there is no
consistency even in this practice. No one, for illustration, now spells
<i>forgetfulness</i> with two <i>l’s</i>, though that method was once
not uncommon.</p>

<p>In fact, on no side has any rational principle been at work, or if
it has shown itself, it has never been allowed to carry out fully
the results at which it has arrived. Against the agencies which have
tended to widen the gulf between orthography and orthoepy counteracting
influences, indeed, have at times manifested themselves. Two measures,
in particular, the language has unconsciously taken to lighten the load
under which it has been staggering. One of them is a natural action on
the part of the users of speech; the other, though a growth, partakes
of the nature of an artificial device. Both, however, have exerted an
appreciable influence in making the spelling indicate the sound. The
first to be considered is very limited in its operations. In ancient
days, when pronunciation was changed the spelling was changed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span> order
to denote it. With the petrifaction of the orthography this in time
became generally impossible. Since, therefore, the spelling could not
be altered to accord with the pronunciation, there sprang up a tendency
to alter the pronunciation to accord with the spelling. Letters once
unsounded came to be heard. Syllables previously crushed out of all
recognition were restored to their full rights. These agencies never
have exerted and never can exert influence on any large scale. Still,
they have been operative in some degree and continue to be active.
Accordingly, when the disposition manifests itself to bring about in
such ways consonance between orthography and orthoepy, it is not worth
while to make now any change in the spelling. A few examples will make
this point perfectly clear.</p>

<p>Any one who compares the pronunciation given in the dictionaries at
the beginning of the nineteenth century with that now sanctioned by
similar authorities, will be struck by a number of instances in which a
given word was once not pronounced in accordance with its spelling, but
is so at the present time. Take, for illustration, <i>housewife</i>.
A century and more ago its regularly authorized pronunciation was
<i>huzzif</i>. This continues still. Much more commonly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span> however, each
syllable which enters into the compound is heard exactly as it would be
were it used separately. The older pronunciation has mainly died out
in consequence of men learning the language more through the eye than
the ear; though in this particular case the degradation of the word to
<i>huzzy</i> has probably contributed its aid to produce the result.</p>

<p><i>Chart</i> will supply us with another illustration. A century
ago it was frequently pronounced <i>cart</i>. <i>Cognizance</i> and
<i>recognizance</i>, too, have now taken up generally the sound of
<i>g</i>, though in legal circles this letter still frequently remains
suppressed. Take, again, the case of some words in which <i>qu</i> had
once the sound of <i>k</i> as it is still heard in <i>etiquette</i> and
<i>coquette</i>. Walker informs us that in his day <i>harlequin</i> and
<i>quadrille</i> were pronounced <i>har-le-kin</i> and <i>ka-drill</i>.
In both these instances, under the influence of the printed word, the
<i>qu</i> has generally abandoned the sound of <i>k</i> for the regular
sound which we ordinarily associate with this digraph. The same thing
is going on in the case of <i>masquerade</i>. The dictionaries, which
rarely record such changes till they have been fully accomplished,
give us no intimation of this fact. This last observation applies also
to <i>pretty</i>, in which <i>e</i> has regularly the sound of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span> short
<i>i</i>. But the disposition to give the vowel here its strictly
proper sound is showing itself in the case of this word. If left to run
its natural course, it is likely in time to become predominant.</p>

<p>As a general rule, however, words subject to influences of this sort
are not likely to be those commonly heard in conversation. They belong
to the class which are more usually met in books. There he who sees
them for the first time is disposed to make the pronunciation accord
as near as possible to the spelling. To this rule there are occasional
notable exceptions. I have heard even educated men—at least, men who
were generally so regarded—pronounce the words <i>English</i> and
<i>England</i> just as they are spelled—that is, the initial syllable
was sounded as <i>ĕng</i> and not as <i>ĭng</i>. No such pronunciation
is ever likely to become common enough to bring itself into notice;
but that it should exist at all is proof of how wide-reaching is the
tendency just mentioned.</p>

<p>These words themselves, it may be added, are interesting illustrations
of one of the various agencies which have done so much with us to
bring about divergence between orthography and orthoepy. In our
earlier speech there were two ways of denoting this initial syllable,
corresponding,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span> without doubt, to the two ways in which it was
pronounced. In one case it was spelled <i>eng</i>, as it is now, in
close accordance with its derivation. In the other case it was spelled
<i>ing</i>, giving us, with the usual orthographic variations, the
forms <i>Ingland</i> and <i>Inglish</i>. Here a genuine difference in
sound conveyed to the ear was represented to the eye by a difference of
orthography. The modern speech has made one of its usual compromises.
It has retained the spelling of the one form and the pronunciation
of the other. A similar story can be told of <i>colonel</i>, which
had once as an allied form <i>coronel</i>. It is likewise true of
<i>lieutenant</i>. In the case of this word, what is regular in the
United States is exceptional in England, and vice versa. With us the
pronunciation of the first syllable is almost universally in accordance
with that of the simple word <i>lieu</i>, which is its original. In
England it is not allowed to be contaminated by any sound which might
indicate its derivation. From a by-gone spelling, <i>lef</i>, comes the
pronunciation there prevalent. This has survived the form that created
it.</p>

<p>But the most striking illustration of a change, mainly effected by the
agency of the written word, is seen in the past participle <i>been</i>.
There is little question—there is, indeed, no question—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span> at
the beginning of the nineteenth century, and even much later, the
digraph <i>ee</i> in this word had in cultivated speech the sound of
short <i>i</i>. It is not meant that the other pronunciation which
rymed it with <i>seen</i> was not sometimes heard; but merely that it
was then so limited in use that orthoepists hardly thought it worth
while to recognize its existence. Walker admitted no pronunciation
of <i>been</i> save that which made it ryme with <i>sin</i>. He had
heard of the other, but he had only heard of it. So said Sheridan,
his contemporary and rival. So said Smart, his reviser and successor,
writing in the middle of the nineteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Yet, with no
support from the most prominent lexical authorities, the pronunciation
of <i>been</i> to ryme with <i>seen</i> instead of <i>sin</i>, steadily
gained ground in England during the last century. There it seems to
have become finally the prevalent one. To it the New Historical English
Dictionary, while sanctioning both ways of pronouncing the word, gives
the preference—at least, the apparent preference.</p>

<p>The growth of this practice has, without question, been largely
and perhaps mainly due to the fact that the digraph <i>ee</i> has
been practically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span> confined to the representation of a single sound.
It has become to us a phonetic symbol, denoting almost invariably
the so-called “long <i>e</i>.” Having this sound in nearly every
case, there is unconsciously developed the feeling that it ought
to have it always. For the sake of conforming to it, <i>been</i>
has in consequence steadily tended to abandon its once more common
pronunciation. This single example is of special interest, because
of the proof it furnishes of the unifying tendency that would be
exerted over language were phonetic symbols with fixed values
employed to represent one sound and but one sound. It does more than
that. It indicates the only way in which permanence can be given to
pronunciation.</p>

<p>Even now, so marked is the influence of the training of the eye
as compared with that of the ear, that efforts consciously or
unconsciously go on to modify the sound of the word as we have been
accustomed to hear it to the form of it which we are accustomed to
see. It is no unusual thing to hear persons painfully striving to
pronounce the final <i>n</i> of <i>condemn</i>, <i>contemn</i>, and
similar verbs, making themselves very miserable when they fail, and
others very miserable when they succeed. But, after all, efforts to
bring about in this way accord between form and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span> sound can affect only
a very limited class of words. The gap between orthography and orthoepy
is, with us, too wide and impassable for the latter ever to close up.
The most we can do is in process of time to revive the pronunciation
of a few letters that are now silent, or to substitute a few forms
etymologically correct for the corruptions by which they have been
supplanted. When either of these courses shows signs of immediate or
even of ultimate adoption, it is not worth while to disturb the coming
of that result by present attempts at alteration. But in its best
estate the changes of pronunciation to accord with the spelling cannot,
as regards influence, be compared with the much more ancient device now
to be considered. This consists in appending an unpronounced <i>e</i>
to the final syllable to indicate that the preceding vowel is long.
This method early evolved itself out of the confusion in which our
orthography was involved as a sort of help to denote the pronunciation
by the spelling.</p>

<p>There seems to be something peculiarly attractive to our race in
the letter <i>e</i>. Especially is this so when it serves no useful
purpose. Adding it at random to syllables, and especially to final
syllables, is supposed to give a peculiar old-time flavor to the
spelling. For this belief there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span> is, to some extent, historic
justification. The letter still remains appended to scores of words in
which it has lost the pronunciation once belonging to it. Again, it has
been added to scores of others apparently to amplify their proportions.
We have in our speech a large number of monosyllables. As a sort of
consolation to their shrunken condition an <i>e</i> has been appended
to them, apparently to make them present a more portly appearance. The
fancy we all have for this vowel not only recalls the wit but suggests
the wisdom of Charles Lamb’s exquisite pun upon Pope’s line that our
race is largely made up of “the mob of gentlemen who write with ease.”
The belief, in truth, seems to prevail that the final <i>e</i> is
somehow indicative of aristocracy. In proper names, particularly, it
is felt to impart a certain distinction to the appellation, lifting it
far above the grade of low associations. It has the crowning merit of
uselessness; and in the eyes of many uselessness seems to be regarded
as the distinguishing mark of any noble class, either of things or
persons. Still, I have so much respect for the rights of property that
it seems to me every man ought to have the privilege of spelling and
pronouncing his own name in any way he pleases.</p>

<p>The prevalence of this letter at the end of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span> words was largely due
to the fact that the vowels <i>a</i>, <i>o</i>, and <i>u</i> of the
original endings were all weakened to it in the break-up of the
language which followed the Norman conquest. Hence, it became the
common ending of the noun. The further disappearance of the consonant
<i>n</i> from the original termination of the infinitive extended this
usage to the verb. The Anglo-Saxon <i>tellan</i> and <i>helpan</i>,
for instance, after being weakened to <i>tellen</i> and <i>helpen</i>,
became <i>telle</i> and <i>helpe</i>. Words not of native origin fell
under the influence of this general tendency and adopted an <i>e</i> to
which they were in nowise entitled. Even Anglo-Saxon nouns which ended
in a consonant—such, for instance, as <i>hors</i> and <i>mús</i> and
<i>stán</i>—are now represented by <i>horse</i> and <i>mouse</i> and
<i>stone</i>. The truth is, that when the memory of the earlier form
of the word had passed away an <i>e</i> was liable to be appended, on
any pretext, to the end of it. The feeling still continues to affect
us all. Our eyes have become so accustomed to seeing a final <i>e</i>
which no one thinks of pronouncing, that the word is felt by some to
have a certain sort of incompleteness if it be not found there. In no
other way can I account for Lord Macaulay’s spelling the comparatively
modern verb <i>edit</i> as <i>edite</i>. This seems to be a distinction
peculiar to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>How widely prevalent at one period became the use of this final
<i>e</i> can be brought out sharply by an examination of a few pages
of a single work. Take, for example, <i>The Schoolmaster</i> of Roger
Ascham. This was published in 1570. In the admirable reprint of it,
executed by Professor Arber, the preface occupies eight pages. In
this limited space we find an <i>e</i> appended to no small number
of words from which it is now dropped. It appears in the nouns
<i>bargaine</i>, <i>beginninge</i>, <i>booke</i>, <i>daye</i>,
<i>deale</i>, <i>deede</i>, <i>eare</i>, <i>feare</i>, <i>fructe</i>
(fruit), <i>gowne</i>, <i>greife</i> (<i>sic</i>), <i>hinte</i>,
<i>kinde</i>, <i>learninge</i>, <i>logike</i>, <i>minde</i>,
<i>realme</i>, <i>rhetorike</i>, <i>silke</i>, <i>sonne</i>,
<i>spirite</i>, <i>sworde</i>, <i>stuffe</i>, <i>taulke</i>,
<i>wisdome</i>, <i>wonte</i>, and <i>worke</i>; in the verbs
<i>beare</i>, <i>gatte</i> (preterite), <i>looke</i>, <i>passe</i>,
<i>seeme</i>, <i>teache</i>, <i>thanke</i>, <i>thinke</i>, <i>tooke</i>
(preterite), and <i>waulke</i>; in the adjectives <i>certaine</i>,
<i>fewe</i>, <i>fitte</i>, <i>fonde</i>, <i>lewde</i> or <i>leude</i>,
<i>lothe</i>, <i>meane</i>, <i>olde</i>, <i>poore</i>, <i>shrewde</i>,
and <i>sweete</i>; and in the adverbs <i>againe</i>, <i>agoe</i>,
<i>cheife</i> (<i>sic</i>), and <i>doune</i>. On the other hand, this
final <i>e</i> is absent from some words where it is now regularly
found. <i>Come</i> and <i>become</i>, for example, appear as <i>cum</i>
and <i>becum</i>, and <i>tongue</i> as <i>tong</i>.</p>

<p>In the chaos which came over the spelling in consequence of the
uncertainty attached to the sound of the vowels, the final <i>e</i>
was seized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span> upon as a sort of help to indicate the pronunciation.
Its office in this respect was announced as early as the end of the
sixteenth century; at least, then it was announced that an unsounded
<i>e</i> at the end of a word indicated that the preceding vowel was
long. This, it hardly need be said, is a crude and unscientific method
of denoting pronunciation. It is a process purely empirical. It is far
removed from the ideal that no letter should exist in a word which is
not sounded. Yet, to some extent, this artificial makeshift has been
and still is a working principle. Were it carried out consistently
it might be regarded as, on the whole, serving a useful purpose. But
here, as well as elsewhere, the trail of the orthographic serpent
is discoverable. Here, as elsewhere, it renders impossible the full
enjoyment of even this slight section of an orthographic paradise.
Here, as elsewhere, manifests itself the besetting sin of our spelling,
that there is no consistency in the application of any principle. Some
of our most common verbs violate the rule (if rule it can be called),
such as <i>have</i>, <i>give</i>, <i>love</i>, <i>are</i>, <i>done</i>.
In these the preceding vowel is not long but short. There are further
large classes of words ending in <i>ile</i>, <i>ine</i>, <i>ite</i>,
<i>ive</i>, where this final <i>e</i> would serve to mislead the
inquirer as to the pronunciation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span> had he no other source of information
than the spelling.</p>

<p>Still, in the case of some of these words the operation of this
principle has had, and is doubtless continuing to have, a certain
influence. Take, for instance, the word <i>hostile</i>. In the
early nineteenth century, if we can trust the most authoritative
dictionaries, this word was regularly pronounced in England as if
spelled <i>hos’-tĭl</i>. So it is to-day in America. But the influence
of the final <i>e</i> has tended to prolong, in the former country, the
sound of the preceding <i>i</i>. Consequently, a usual, and probably
the usual, pronunciation there is <i>hos-tīle</i>. We can see a
similar tendency manifested in the case of several other adjectives.
A disposition to give many of them the long diphthongal sound of
the <i>i</i> is frequently displayed in the pronunciation of such
words as <i>agile</i>, <i>docile</i>, <i>ductile</i>, <i>futile</i>,
<i>infantile</i>. Save in the case of the last one of this list,
the dictionaries once gave the <i>ile</i> nothing but the sound of
<i>il</i>; now they usually authorize both ways.</p>

<p>Were the principle here indicated fully carried out, pronunciations
now condemned as vulgarisms would displace those now considered
correct. In accordance with it, for instance, <i>engine</i>, as it
is spelled, should strictly have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span> the <i>i</i> long. One of the
devices employed by Dickens in <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> to ridicule
what he pretended was the American speech was to have the characters
pronounce <i>genuine</i> as <i>gen-u-īne</i>, <i>prejudice</i> as
<i>prej-u-dīce</i>, <i>active</i> and <i>native</i> as <i>ac-tȳve</i>
and <i>na-tīve</i>. Doubtless he heard such pronunciations from some
men. Yet, in these instances, the speaker was carried along by the
same tendency which in cultivated English has succeeded in turning
the pronunciation <i>hos-tĭl</i> into <i>hos-tīle</i>. Were there any
binding force in the application of the rule which imparts to the
termination <i>e</i> the power of lengthening the preceding vowel, no
one would have any business to give to it in the final syllable of the
words just specified any other sound than that of “long <i>i</i>.” The
pronunciations ridiculed by Dickens would be the only pronunciations
allowable. Accordingly, the way to make the rule universally effective
is to drop this final <i>e</i> when it does not produce such an effect.
If <i>genuine</i> is to be pronounced <i>gen-u-ĭn</i>, so it ought to
be spelled.</p>

<p>For a long period, indeed, in the early history of our speech, whenever
pronunciation changed, spelling was changed for the sake of denoting
it properly. If a letter then became silent, it had no rights which
any one felt bound to respect.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span> It was incontinently dropped. No one
needs to be told that this has all been changed in modern times. With
us it has become both the belief and the practice that if a letter has
once got into the spelling of a word, no matter how unlawfully, it has
acquired the right of remaining there forever. In consequence, our
language is encumbered with a lot of alphabetic squatters which have
settled down upon the orthography without any regard to the opposing
claims of either derivation or pronunciation. The mental attitude which
at first tolerated and at last has learned to love these nuisances
sprang up after the invention of printing. The influence of this art
upon the spelling is something that cannot well be overestimated. Any
confusion which might before have existed in it became from this time
worse confounded. Upon the introduction of printing, indeed, English
orthography entered into the realm of chaos and old night, in which it
has ever since been floundering. Then it began to put on the shape it
at present bears, “if shape it may be called which shape has none.”</p>

<p>The evil effects wrought on the orthography by printing, as contrasted
with the previous method of manuscript reproduction, were largely
due to the difference of conditions under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span> which the two arts were
carried on. The early type-setters, indeed, had to encounter the same
difficulties which beset the copyists of manuscripts. There were among
educated men the widest diversities of pronunciation. No established
literary, still less established orthoepic standard, to which all felt
obliged to conform, could possibly grow up during the long civil strife
of the fifteenth century. Disorder and confusion, which in many cases
had their origin as far back as the coming together in one tongue of
two conflicting phonetic systems, continued to prevail to a great
extent. But the copyists of manuscripts, compared with the type-setters
who succeeded them, were men of education. Some degree of cultivation
was essential to a profession which demanded as the first condition
of success the ability to gain a clear conception of an author’s
meaning. In accordance with the practice then universally prevailing,
they would give to the word the spelling which to them represented the
pronunciation. As educated men, this would be done in the majority of
cases with a reasonable degree of accuracy.</p>

<p>Still, that the copyists of manuscripts were a long way from reaching
the highest ideal of excellence we know from incontestable authority.
The corruption of the text caused by their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span> wilfulness or carelessness
was one of the few things that seem to have vexed the genial soul of
the first great singer of our literature. Chaucer in his address to
Adam, the scrivener, complains of the great trouble to which he is put
in revising his works by the latter’s negligence. A fervent prayer is
made that he may have a scalled head if he does not hereafter adhere
to the original writing more closely. Toward the end of <i>Troilus and
Cryseyde</i> there is, as Mr. Ellis remarked, something almost pathetic
in his address to his “litel boke”</p>

<p class="poetry">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And for ther is so greet dyversitee</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In Englissh and in writynge of our tonge,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So preye I God, that non myswrite thee,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ne the mys-metere for defaut of tonge.</span><br>
</p>

<p>It is not likely that either imprecation or imploration had much
effect upon the scribes of that day, who were probably as perverse a
generation as the scribes of old. But one thing is to be said in their
behalf. The cardinal principle that the proper office of orthography is
to represent orthoepy they never lost sight of, however wofully they
may have failed in carrying it into effect. Had this been consistently
kept in view, the attainment of a reasonably complete correspondence
between spelling and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span> pronunciation, while it might have been long
delayed, would have been sure to follow at last.</p>

<p>All this was checked and finally reversed by the introduction of
printing. Far higher requirements, as has been intimated, were needed
in the work of the copyist than in the mere mechanical labor of the
type-setter. The former had to understand his author to represent
correctly what he said. But there is no such necessity in the case of
the compositor. Whatever intellect he may have, he will not be called
upon to use it to any great extent in his special line of activity. His
duty is done if he faithfully follows copy, and he can perform his work
well in a language of which he does not comprehend a word. His labor
is and must always be mostly mechanical. The very fact that he is not
responsible for results will inevitably have a tendency to make him
careless in details. The blunders in spelling, and in greater matters
still, shown in modern printing-offices where the most scrupulous
care is exerted to attain correctness are familiar to all. These
evils would be immensely increased at a period when no such extensive
precautions against error were taken in any case, and when in some
cases it would seem as if no precautions were taken at all. The effects
of the carelessness and indifference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span> that frequently prevailed would
not be and were not confined to the work in which they were directly
manifested. The orthography of printed matter necessarily reacts upon
the orthography of the men who are familiar with it. These, when they
come to write, will be apt to repeat the errors they have learned from
the books they read. With that peculiar ability in blundering shown
by all careless spellers, they will further contribute numberless
variations of their own. These in turn will be followed more or less
by the type-setter. Thus, new forms will be constantly added to the
prevailing disorder. In this manner a complete circle is formed in
which author and printer corrupt each other, and both together corrupt
the public.</p>

<p>Such was, in great measure, the situation of things in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries. Differences of spelling in the same book
and on the same page were found constantly. But necessarily it was a
situation which could not continue. To a printing-office, uniformity
of orthography, if not absolutely essential, is, to say the least,
highly desirable. Toward uniformity, therefore, the printing-offices
steadily bent their aim, since nobody and nothing else would. The
movement in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span> direction was powerfully helped forward by the
feeling, which had been steadily gaining strength after the revival of
classical learning, that the office, or at least one great office, of
orthography is to indicate derivation. Belief in this involved in its
very nature the notion of fixedness of spelling. It therefore gave the
sanction of a quasi-scholarship to the demand for an unvarying standard
which came from a mechanic art. Under the pressing needs of the
printing-office, the movement toward uniformity made steady progress
during the seventeenth century and the first half of the eighteenth.
Wide variations continued to be found in works bearing the imprint of
different establishments. We must remember that there were then no
dictionaries that men were disposed to consider authoritative. It was
not until the eighteenth century that these began to exist on any scale
worth mentioning, or that much respect was paid to the spellings they
sanctioned. Each printing-office was largely a law unto itself.</p>

<p>But the desire for uniformity became more insistent as time went on. At
last it succeeded in reaching the end it had in view. But unfortunately
for us, the establishment of the orthography was in no way the work of
scholars, though this was largely a result of their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span> indolence and
indifference. It came into the hands of men who knew nothing about it
and cared still less. In consequence, it was a haphazard orthography
that was fixed upon us. In the selections made by compositors and
proofreaders from the variations of spelling which then prevailed,
it was the merest accident or the blindest caprice that dictated the
choice of the form to be permanently adopted. Authors themselves seem
rarely to have taken any interest in the matter. The uniformity, or
the approach to uniformity, we have now was accordingly the work of
printers and not of scholars. As might be expected, the result of it
is a mere conventional uniformity. In no sense of the word is it a
scientific one. In effecting it, propriety was disregarded, etymology
was perverted, and every principle of orthoepy defied. Men of culture
blindly followed in the wake of a movement which they had not the power
and probably not the knowledge to direct. Certainly they lacked the
disposition. To the orthography thus manufactured Johnson’s Dictionary,
which came out in 1755, gave authority, gave currency—gave, in fact,
universality. But it could not give consistency nor reason, for in it
they were not to be found.</p>

<p>As a consequence of the wide acceptance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span> this orthography, the
petrifaction of the written speech which had been steadily going on
for at least two centuries was now practically made complete. So far
as the forms of the words were concerned, it assumed more and more the
character of a dead language. But in the meanwhile the spoken tongue
remained full of vigor and life. As a necessary consequence, it was
constantly undergoing modification. While the spelling stood still,
changes in pronunciation were numerous and rapid. Whether they were
for the better or for the worse is not pertinent to this inquiry. But
the inevitable result was to widen steadily the gulf that had long
before begun to disclose itself as existing between the written and
the spoken word. That result is before us. No particular value having
been attached to any vowel or combination of vowels, there is nothing
to determine the exact value they should have when they appear in a
particular syllable. For the pronunciation we go not necessarily to the
word itself but to somewhere else. Every member of the English race
has to learn two languages, every member of the English race uses two
languages. The one he reads and writes; the other he speaks.</p>

<p>Two languages, it has just been said, we have: one we write, and
one we speak. To bring them even remotely into conformity is one of
the hardest problems to solve that was ever put before the users of
any tongue. It is manifest from the survey which was made of the
orthographic situation, that the difficulties which stand in the way
of reforming English spelling are not the difficulties which are
ordinarily paraded. There are arguments against any change whatever.
They do not seem to me strong ones, but they are honestly held.
Furthermore, they are held by men who know too much about the language
to be imposed upon by the cheap objections, which come from the
unknowing or the unthinking. The only one of serious importance is the
existence of that period of uncertainty and confusion which must attend
the transition from the old to the new. This, to be sure, has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span> always
existed to some extent. Once it existed to a great extent. It exists
at the present day. The introductions or appendixes to our larger
dictionaries contain lists of from fifteen hundred to two thousand
words which still continue to be spelled in different ways. But many
of these are not in common use. Hence, the number of them makes little
impression upon the common mind.</p>

<p>But as no reform of any kind ever yet proved an unmixed blessing, so
will not reform of English orthography. Especially will this be true
of it at its introduction. A change of spelling on any large scale
will involve for the time being certain disadvantages. The conflict
between the old that is going out and the new that is coming in cannot
fail to produce more or less of annoyance. These disturbances, indeed,
last only for a time; but to some they are very real while they do
last. Those of us who believe that the permanent benefits accruing
to the users of our tongue from a reform of our orthography outweigh
immensely the temporary inconveniences and annoyances to which they
will be subject, can well afford to bear with the hesitation of those
who like the end in view, but dislike the time and toil that must be
gone through in order to reach it. There must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span> always be taken into
consideration the existence of a class of persons who look upon the
present state of our orthography as an evil, but an evil that cannot be
got rid of without costing more than the benefits received in return.</p>

<p>But such reasons for reluctance to unsettle the existing condition
of things are widely different from the pretentious objections that
are regularly advanced by those who have not studied the subject
sufficiently to understand the real difficulties that lie in the way.
Yet these imaginary obstacles loom up so large in the minds of many
that they must receive a respectable amount of consideration, even if
they are hardly entitled to respectful consideration. It is not for
any value they have in themselves that they are discussed here. It
is because they are constantly urged by men whose opinions on other
subjects are frequently of highest value. The utter hollowness of these
common objections to spelling reform will be shown in the course of
the following pages, as well as the unconscious insincerity of those
advancing them. I say unconscious, because the insincerity has not
been caused by any attempt to ignore the facts or to conceal them.
It is simply that these have never occurred to them. But I further
say insincerity, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span> the moment the real facts are brought to
their attention, they refuse to apply to particular cases the general
principles upon which they have been loudly insisting. The further
great difficulty in dealing with the honest objector does not consist
merely in showing him that he is wrong in his facts. It is to make
clear that his reasoning is wrong in the few instances in which his
facts are right.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>The first of these objections is connected with the subject of
derivation. There goes on, we are told, an irrepressible conflict
between etymological spelling and phonetic, or anything approaching
phonetic spelling. If the latter come to occupy the foremost place,
the former, it is asserted, will disappear. Incalculable harm would
thereby be wrought both to the speech and to its speakers. According to
some, life would become a burden to the individual, and the language
would be ruined beyond redemption, if the spelling of a word should
hide from our eyes the source from which it came. The mystic tie that
binds the speech of the past to that of the present would be severed.
This is the special argument which comes not unfrequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span> from members
of the educated, and sometimes of the scholarly class, though not
from that section of it which deals with English scholarship. In the
course of the preceding pages there has been constant occasion to
give illustrations of its falsity, and far too often of its fraud.
Consequently, to discuss it directly and at length will seem to many
very much like going through the process of slaying the slain. But it
plays so conspicuous a part in all discussions of spelling reform, that
it is perhaps advisable, if not necessary, to consider it with special
fulness of detail.</p>

<p>There is no question, indeed, that this argument based upon etymology
has the strongest hold upon the educated class. It is constantly
brought forward as if it were sufficient of itself to settle the
question. Words, we are told, have a descent of their own. Letters
which are never heard in the spoken speech, and indeed cannot be
pronounced by any conceivable position known to us of our vocal organs,
are not to be dropped from the written speech, because they remind us,
or at least remind some of us, of forms in the languages from which
they originally came. It sends a peculiar thrill of rapture, we are
assured, through the heart of the student to find, for illustration, in
<i>deign</i>, <i>reign</i>, <i>feign</i>, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span> <i>impugn</i>, a letter
<i>g</i> which he never thinks of pronouncing. Silent as it is to the
ear, it is, nevertheless, eloquent with all the tender associations
connected with <i>dignor</i>, <i>fingo</i>, <i>regno</i>, and
<i>impugno</i>. That persons with little education, and on the other
hand persons with the highest linguistic training, should not share in
these feelings is not at all to the purpose. Such are not really the
ones to be consulted. Between these two classes lies a vast body of
educated men whose wishes in this matter should be considered paramount.</p>

<p>That this argument in their behalf may not be charged with
misrepresentation, take the following passage from Archbishop Trench,
one of the deservedly favorite linguistic writers of the previous
generation. Furthermore, as about the only English scholar of any
repute who has come to the aid of the opponents of spelling reform,
his words deserve quotation on that very account. He is giving as a
reason for the retention of useless letters that while they are silent
to the ear, they remain eloquent to the eye. “It is urged, indeed,”
wrote Trench, “as an answer to this, that the scholar does not need
these indications to help him to the pedigree of the words with which
he deals, that the ignorant is not helped by them; that the one knows
without, and the other does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span> know with them; so that, in either
case, they are profitable for nothing. Let it be freely granted that
this, in both these cases, is true; but between these two extremes
there is a multitude of persons, neither accomplished scholars on
the one side, nor yet wholly without the knowledge of all languages
save their own on the other; and I cannot doubt that it is of great
value that these should have all helps enabling them to recognize the
words which they are using, whence they came, to what words in other
languages they are nearly related, and what is their properest and
strictest meaning.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Now, in the first place, were all this true, the objection would not
be a valid one. The well-being of the many is always to be preferred
to the satisfaction of the few. A language does not exist for the sake
of imparting joyful emotions to the members of a particular group who
are familiar with its sources. When committed to writing it is so
committed for the purpose of conveying clearly to the eye the sounds
heard by the ear. Anything in the form of the printed word which stands
in the way of the speediest arrival at such a result is to that extent
objectionable. But even this so-called advantage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span> of suggesting origins
is distinctly limited. What educated men know of the sources of words
is almost entirely confined to Latin and Greek. Of the earlier forms of
the more common native words and of their meanings the immense majority
of even the most highly cultivated are ignorant. Their ignorance,
however, does not seem to impair their happiness any more than it does
their comprehension.</p>

<p>But the objection, further, is a purely artificial one. The happiness
conferred is a happiness assumed to be confined to the words in
their present form. The example of other tongues shows there is no
justification for this belief. The Italian is a phonetic language.
Does any one believe that an Italian scholar experiences any less
satisfaction in finding the Græco-Latin <i>philosophia</i>, converted
in his speech into <i>filosofia</i> than an English one does in
seeing it in the form <i>philosophy</i>? Has his language suffered
any material injury in consequence? Were I not myself inconsistent
and lazy and several other disreputable adjectives, I should write
<i>fonetic</i> instead of <i>phonetic</i>. This I cheerfully admit.
But were not the strictly virtuous defenders of spelling according to
derivation equally lacking in consistency, and absolutely unfaithful
to the high etymological ideals they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span> hold up for our admiration, they
would be writing <i>phansy</i>, at least, instead of <i>fancy</i>.
In one of the sporadic attacks of common-sense which have sometimes
overtaken the users of our speech, <i>f</i> has displaced <i>ph</i>
in this word, though to prevent the result from being wholly rational
it has substituted <i>c</i> for <i>s</i>. The Greek <i>phantasia</i>
has come down to us through <i>phantasy</i>, <i>fantasy</i>, and has
finally subsided into the present form. To the believer in etymological
spelling <i>fancy</i> ought to be as objectionable as <i>fonetic</i>.</p>

<p>In the second place, the hollowness of this pretended regard for
etymology is not only detected, it is emphasized by the fact that
the opposition to change is equally pronounced in the case of words
where the present form is the result of blundering ignorance which
gives an utterly erroneous idea of their origin. Can any antagonist
of simplification be induced by his devotion to derivation to abandon
<i>comptroller</i>? This corrupt spelling does more than defy the
pronunciation of the word; it gives an utterly false impression of its
source. <i>Controller</i> is in Anglo-French <i>contre-rollour</i>,
in law Latin <i>contra-rotulator</i>. These, again, were taken from
the Latin <i>contra</i>, ‘against,’ and the diminutive <i>rotulus</i>,
<i>rotula</i>, ‘a little wheel,’ which word in the middle ages acquired
the meaning of ‘roll.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span> The controller, in consequence, was the one
who kept the counter-roll or register, by which the entries on some
other roll were tested. How naturally the possession of such an office
would be apt to give to him holding it “control” over certain others,
in the modern sense of the word, is apparent on the surface. But in
the sixteenth century, and even earlier, some members of that class,
“neither accomplished scholars on the one side nor yet wholly without
the knowledge of all languages save their own on the other,” got it
into their heads that the first part of the word came from the French
<i>compter</i>, ‘to count.’ Hence came the unphonetic spelling based
upon a blunder of derivation!</p>

<p>Take two other examples, illustrative of this attitude of opposition.
Could any upholder of etymological spelling be induced to drop
the <i>c</i> of <i>scent</i>, though nobody ever pronounced the
intruding letter? Yet, as it comes from the Latin <i>sent-ire</i>, the
substitution of <i>scent</i> for the previous <i>sent</i> destroys
in this case for the vast majority of educated men that delightful
reminiscence of the classic tongues which, we are told, imparts so
peculiar a charm to the present orthography. Mitford, the historian of
Greece, was subjected to ceaseless ridicule and vituperation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span> because
he preferred the correct etymological form <i>iland</i>, and refused
to adopt the <i>s</i> which had been inserted into the word under the
blundering belief that it was either derived from or was in some way
related to the Latin <i>insula</i> and the French <i>isle</i>.</p>

<p>In truth, the argument of derivation is invoked only to retain whatever
orthographic anomalies we chance to have. It is abjured the moment an
effort is made to root out any etymological anomalies which have been
introduced into the speech. The fact is that if spelling according
to derivation were heeded it would result in changes to which those
proposed by any advocate of simplification of spelling would seem
absurdly trivial. This would be particularly noticeable in the case of
words derived from native sources. The opponent of spelling reform who
bases his hostility upon etymological grounds would be aghast were he
asked to conform to his principles in his practice. Out indeed would go
the <i>h</i> of the very word <i>aghast</i> just used. Nothing would
induce him to drop the intruding letter in this case or other letters
in scores of other cases, though their only effect is to hide the
origin of the word. Or take, for illustration of mere uselessness, the
<i>k</i> of whole classes of words of native origin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span> The letter was as
little known to the Anglo-Saxon alphabet as it was to the Roman. Hence,
were spelling according to derivation strictly enforced, it would have
to disappear from no small number of words where it is not merely
superfluous as regards pronunciation, but gives an entirely erroneous
impression of the form from which it came. It has been remarked that
the original of <i>back</i> was <i>bæc</i>, of <i>quick</i> was
<i>cwic</i>, of <i>stock</i> was <i>stoc</i>, of <i>sick</i> was
<i>seoc</i>. Imagine the indignant feelings of the assumed ardent
devotee of spelling according to derivation if he were asked to drop
the final letter from these words. Yet from his own point of view it
has no business there at all.</p>

<p>To a certain extent this particular brand of ruin had already overtaken
the language. From the native words no one had ever thought of
discarding the final <i>k</i>, because scarcely any one knew of the
forms these originally had. But knowledge of Latin was widespread.
Regard for derivation succeeded, therefore, in banishing it from whole
classes of words taken from that language. The struggle, however,
was long. The authority of Doctor Johnson was in vain invoked for
its retention. One must be familiar with the history of orthography
to appreciate what dissensions sprang up in once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span> happy homes, what
prognostics were indulged in of the ruin that would betide the speech,
were men ever to be induced to spell <i>musick</i> and <i>historick</i>
and <i>prosaick</i>, and a host of similar words, without their final
<i>k</i>. Boswell, who could not help reproaching Johnson for dropping
the vowel <i>u</i> from <i>authour</i>, praised him for standing up
for the retention of this final consonant. He represents him as saying
that he spelled <i>Imlac</i> in <i>Rasselas</i> with a <i>c</i> at the
end because by so doing it was less like English, which, he continued,
“should always have the Saxon <i>k</i> added to the <i>c</i>.” The
“Saxon k” was the lexicographer’s personal contribution to the original
English alphabet. “I hope,” continued Boswell, “the authority of the
great master of our language will stop this curtailing innovation by
which we see <i>critic</i>, <i>public</i>, etc., frequently written
instead of <i>critick</i>, <i>publick</i>, etc.”</p>

<p>The biographer’s hopes were doomed, however, to disappointment. Walker,
the favorite lexicographer of a hundred years ago, bowed to the storm,
while he deplored the havoc it had wrought. “It has been a custom
within these twenty years,” he wrote, “to omit the <i>k</i> at the
end of words when preceded by <i>c</i>. This has introduced a novelty
into the language, which is that of ending a word with an unusual
letter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span> and is not only a blemish on the face of it, but may possibly
produce some irregularity in future formations.” To call it a novelty
was stating the matter too strongly. But to this extent Walker’s
assertion was true, that spelling a word with a final <i>c</i> was only
occasional.</p>

<p>Here we have been considering the dropping of a useless final letter
which has no justification for its existence on the ground of
derivation. This naturally leads to the consideration of the case
in which it is proposed to drop a particular one which has such
justification. This is the no longer pronounced guttural with which, as
one example, <i>through</i> ends. One of the queer objections brought
against the spelling <i>thru</i> was that hardly a word existed in
our language that ended in the letter <i>u</i>. That seemed to the
protester an all-sufficient reason for never letting any of them
have that termination. If the sound was there to be represented,
there seemed no very cogent reason why the letter fitted to represent
it should not perform its office. In the original speech <i>u</i>
terminated some most common words, as <i>sunu</i>, ‘son’; <i>duru</i>,
‘door’; and <i>pu</i>, ‘thou.’ What crime has this unfortunate vowel
committed that it should be deprived of its ancient privilege of
standing at the end of a word? The objection is interesting because it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
shows what sort of reasons intelligent people can be led to believe
and to adduce under the honest impression that these are to be deemed
arguments.</p>

<p>Another fallacy connected with this subject of spelling in conformity
with the derivation is suggested by the extract taken from Archbishop
Trench’s work, rather than directly asserted in it. This is that a
knowledge of the origin of words is a desirable if not an essential
requisite to their proper use. Consequently, the spelling of the
English word should be made to conform to the etymology for that
particular reason. This is an assumption that has no warrant in fact.
The existence of great authors in every literature, who had either no
knowledge or had very imperfect knowledge of the sources of the speech
which they wielded at will, is an argument which may be ignored, and
ordinarily is ignored, because it can never be squarely met. It is
not from their originals or from their past meanings that men learn
the value of the terms they employ. Acquaintance with that comes from
experience or observation, or from familiarity with the usage of the
best speakers and writers. Is the meaning of <i>nausea</i> any plainer
after we have learned that it is by origin a Greek word which come from
<i>naus</i>, ‘ship,’ and in consequence ought strictly to be limited
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span> denoting seasickness? One hour’s experience of the sensation will
give the sufferer a keener appreciation and a preciser knowledge
of the signification than a whole year’s study of the derivation.
Will <i>stirrup</i> be employed with greater clearness after one has
learned that in the earliest English it was <i>stige-râp</i>, and that
accordingly it meant the ‘rope’ by which one ‘sties’ or mounts the
horse? The information thus gained has an independent value of its
own. It may be of interest as satisfying an intelligent curiosity. It
may show that the first stirrups were probably made of ropes. But it
implies a mistaken and confused perception of what is to be derived
from etymological study, to fancy that as a result of it any one will
have a better knowledge of this particular appendage to a saddle or
use the term denoting it with more precision and expressiveness. It is
only in the exceptional cases, when a word is beginning to wander away
from its primitive or strictly proper sense, that the knowledge of the
derivation imparts accuracy of use. Yet even here this knowledge is of
slight value. The transition of meaning is either a natural development
which ought not to be held in check, or it is a general perversion
which the etymological training of the few is in most cases powerless
to arrest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>

<p>One form of this fallacy of derivation is that which connects it with
the history of words. The two are closely allied. They are, indeed,
so closely allied that when one is spoken of, it is the other that is
usually meant. We are often condescendingly assured by the opponent of
spelling reform that its advocates forget that words have a history of
their own. After indulging in this not particularly startling remark he
almost invariably goes on to make clear by illustration that he himself
has no conception of what it means. “Shall we,” asks a writer, after
reciting this well-worn formula—“shall we mask the Roman origin of
<i>Cirencester</i> and <i>Towcester</i> by spelling them Sissiter and
Towster,” as they are pronounced? Now it may not be wise, for various
reasons, to alter the orthography of proper names. But the unwisdom of
it will not be for the reason here given. In this case it is evident
from the words accompanying his protest that what the decryer of change
means to say is that by altering the spelling of the place names, their
history would be obscured. What he actually says, however, is that
their derivation, which is but a single point in their history, would
be hidden from view.</p>

<p>For the leading idea at the bottom of an argument of this sort, if it
has any idea at all, must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span> necessarily be that the particular form
which the word assumed at the first known period of its existence
should be the form religiously preserved for all future time. Now, if
orthography is merely or, even mainly, to represent etymology; if,
further, we are able both to obtain and retain the earliest spelling,
there is method in this madness, even though there be not much sense.
But of the first form we have been able to secure the knowledge with
certainty in only a few instances. Far fewer are the instances in
which we have retained it. Almost invariably it is a form belonging
to some later period that is adopted and set before us as somehow
having attained sanctity. This imputed sanctity works only harm. The
maintenance of one form through all periods not only contributes
nothing to the history of the word, it does all it can to prevent
any knowledge of its history being kept alive. For it is the spoken
word alone that has life. Only by the changes which the written word
undergoes can the record of that life be preserved. If the written
word remains in a fossilized condition, all direct knowledge of the
successive stages through which the spoken word passed, disappears.
The moment a word comes to have a fixed unchangeable exterior form,
no matter what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span> alterations may take place in its interior life, that
is to say, in its pronunciation, that moment its history, independent
of the meaning it conveys, becomes doubtful and obscure. This is
the condition to which English vocables are largely reduced. Their
successive significations can be traced; but knowledge of the important
changes of pronunciation they have undergone becomes difficult, if not
impossible, of attainment.</p>

<p>Two terms designating common diseases may seem to illustrate fairly
well the opposite condition of things here indicated. They are
<i>quinsy</i> and <i>phthisic</i>. The one early dropped the forms
<i>squinancy</i>, <i>squinacy</i>, and <i>squincy</i>, which belonged
to the immediate Romance original. To that an <i>s</i> had been
prefixed. When that letter ceased to be pronounced, no one thought of
retaining it. So for that reason it disappeared from the English, just
as for the opposite reason it has been preserved in the corresponding
French word <i>esquinancie</i>. In this case a history has been
unrolled before us. It is not unlike that seen in the supplanting of
the form <i>chirurgeon</i> by <i>surgeon</i>. On the other hand, take
the case of the word <i>phthisic</i>, as now ordinarily written. This
form gives us no knowledge of the real history of the word. From other
sources we learn that it was once spelled as it is now pronounced.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span> The
most current of several forms was <i>tisik</i>. In Milton it is found
as <i>tizzic</i>. Such a spelling makes evident at once how it was then
sounded, just as still do the corresponding <i>tisico</i> in Italian
and <i>tisica</i> in Spanish. But in the seventeenth century, and even
as early as the sixteenth, scholars went back to the Greek original and
imposed upon the unfortunate word the combination <i>phth</i>, which
by a liberal use of the imagination is supposed to have somehow the
sound of <i>t</i>. This has finally come to prevail over the earlier
phonetic spelling. He whose knowledge of the word is confined to its
present form is almost necessarily led to believe that it was taken
directly from its remote source. From all acquaintance with the various
changes it has undergone, and with the pronunciation it has had at
various periods, he is shut out. Archbishop Trench has pointed out the
transition by which <i>emmet</i> has passed into <i>ant</i> through the
intermediate spellings of <i>emet</i> and <i>amt</i>, which necessarily
represented changes of sound.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> By this means a history has been
unrolled before us. But he certainly had no right to felicitate himself
upon the result. If his theories be true, instead of spelling the word
as we pronounce it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span> which we now do, we ought to adopt in writing the
poetic and dialectic <i>emmet</i> at least, if not the earliest known
form. To employ his own argument, letters silent to the ear would still
be most eloquent to the eye. In this particular case some of us would
be made happy beyond expression by being reminded of the Anglo-Saxon
original <i>æmete</i>.</p>

<p>Even using history in the narrow and imperfect sense in which those
who advance this argument constantly employ it, we are no better
off. Nearly every old word in the language has had different forms
at different periods of its existence. Which one of these is to be
selected as the standard? When does this so-called history begin?
Take the word we spell <i>head</i>. Shall we so write it because it
is the custom to do so now? Or shall we go back to the Anglo-Saxon
original <i>heâfod?</i> Or shall we adopt some one of its three dozen
later forms—such, for instance, as <i>heved</i> or <i>heed</i> or
<i>hed</i>? This last, which with our present pronunciation, would be
a pure phonetic spelling, was more or less in use from the thirteenth
to the eighteenth century. The reason for our preference for the
existing form has no other basis than the habit of association to which
attention has been so frequently called. We do not spell the word<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
as <i>head</i> because it gives us a knowledge of the changes which
have taken place in its history, for this it does not do at all. Nor
do we so spell it because it gives us a knowledge of its derivation,
for this it does very little. Nor further do we so spell it because it
represents pronunciation, for this it does still less. We cling to it
for no other reason than that we are used to it. What is here said of
<i>head</i> can be said of thousands of other words.</p>

<p>Even in the case of Cirencester and Towcester, above mentioned, the
same statement holds good. As there intimated, proper names do not
really enter into the discussion of the general question. Being
individual in their nature, they are more or less under the control of
the individuals who own them. These can and do exercise the right of
changing at will their orthography and their pronunciation. But for the
sake of the argument, let us assume that it would be a gross outrage to
spell the names of these towns as <i>Sissiter</i> and <i>Touster</i>.
Let us admit that by such a change all knowledge of their Roman origin
would be lost to those who did not care enough about it to make the
matter a subject of special study. It is accordingly a natural and,
indeed, a perfectly legitimate inference, that in the designation of
towns the main office of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span> their orthography is to point out who founded
them or how they chanced to come into being.</p>

<p>If this be so, the principle ought to be carried through consistently.
What, in such a case, should be done with <i>Exeter</i>? The ancient
name was <i>Exanceaster</i>, which passed through various changes
of form, among which were <i>Exscester</i> and <i>Excester</i>. As
early, at least, as the reign of Queen Elizabeth it became usually
<i>Exeter</i>. If it be the object of spelling to impart information
about the origin of places, ought we not at any rate to return to
the form <i>Excester</i>, to remind “a multitude of persons, neither
accomplished scholars on the one side, nor yet wholly without the
knowledge of all languages save their own on the other,” that the
Romans once had a permanent military station on the banks of the
Exe? It is to be feared that no devotion to derivation would lead
the inhabitants of the city to sanction such a change. In truth, the
value of all knowledge of this sort is something assumed, not really
substantiated. The few who need it, or wish it, can easily acquire it
without the necessity of perverting orthography from its legitimate
functions to the business of imparting it. How many of the inhabitants
of Boston in Lincolnshire and of Boston in Massachusetts lead useful,
happy, and honored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span> lives, and go down to their graves in blissful
unconsciousness of the fact that the name of their city has been
shortened from Botolph’s Town! How many of them are aware, indeed, that
such a saint as Botolph ever existed at all?</p>

<p>In truth, all knowledge of the history of words ceases for most of us
the moment these assume a fixed form, independent of the sounds they
purport to represent. That history is found in the pronunciation. It is
recorded and revealed to us only by the variations in spelling which
variations in pronunciation require. In this matter the attitude of
the past and of the present is distinctly at variance. Especially is
this so in the case of unpronounced letters. Our ancestors discarded
such without scruple, whether found in the original or not. We cling
to them. We are not content with merely clinging to them. The more
in the way they are, the more we cherish them. This point is brought
out strikingly in the earlier and the later treatment of two initial
letters which ceased to be sounded. These are <i>k</i> and <i>h</i>.
The latter was incontinently dropped in writing when it failed to be
heard in the pronunciation. This, indeed, was done so long ago that
knowledge of the fact that the letter once existed at the beginning of
certain words is now mainly confined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span> to the students of our earlier
speech. In the other case the unpronounced letter is still retained in
the spelling. There is consequently no way for us to determine from
the form of the word when this initial <i>k</i> ceased to be a living
force. That knowledge must be gained with more or less of certainty
from an independent investigation.</p>

<p>It has already been pointed out that there are some two dozen words
in our speech in which an initial <i>k</i> followed by <i>n</i>
is silent.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> If the researches of Mr. Ellis can be trusted, the
dropping of the sound of this letter from pronunciation in the speech
of the educated took place in the seventeenth century. By that time
English orthography was beginning to be subjected to that process of
petrifaction which consummated its work in the century following.
The external form in existence continued to be preserved with little
or no modification, regardless of whatever changes took place in its
internal life. Naturally these words beginning with an unpronounced
<i>k</i> fell under this influence. Take as an illustration the word
<i>knave</i>, corresponding to the German <i>knabe</i>, ‘boy,’ and
having originally the same signification.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span> As regards its meaning the
English word has passed through the successive senses of boy, of a boy
as servant, of a servant without regard to age, of a rascally servant,
and finally of a simple rascal with no reference to the time of life or
the nature of employment. There it remains. The idea both of boyhood
and of service has entirely disappeared. That of rascality, not at all
implied in the original, has now become the predominant sense.</p>

<p>In the case of the signification, we have therefore a complete
history unrolled before us. In the case of the form, we have but a
partial history. It was not so at first. In the earlier period the
spelling of the word changed with its pronunciation. The original was
<i>cnafa</i>. The substitution of <i>k</i> for <i>c</i> indicated no
difference in the sound. But the weakening of the final <i>a</i> to
<i>e</i>, the replacing of <i>f</i> by <i>v</i> denoted the prevalence
at the early period of the idea that the spelling was not designed to
defy pronunciation, but to point it out. Then changes made in it are
evidences of the changes that had been going on in the sound. But when
later the <i>k</i> disappeared from the pronunciation, no attempt was
made to indicate the fact by dropping it also from the spelling. By
that time the printing-office had begun to fasten its fangs upon the
language.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span> Consequently, the letter no longer heard by the ear was
carefully retained to console the eye and burden the memory.</p>

<p>Now, it may not be advisable—at least, for the present—to discard
the unpronounced initial letter in the case of words of this class;
this, too, for reasons entirely independent of the feelings of
association. The revival of the phonetic sense among the men of the
English-speaking race is possible as a result of an extensive reform
of English spelling. In that case the pronunciation of <i>k</i> before
<i>n</i> might be resumed in English speech, just as it is still
found in German. The letter, indeed, continues yet to be heard in
English dialects, so that in one sense it has never died out. Highly
improbable, therefore, as is the resumption of the sound, it is at
least possible. This consideration, though it can not form an argument,
may suggest a pretext for not discarding it at present. But to retain
it on the ground of derivation is more than irrational in itself. It is
absolutely inconsistent with the attitude which has been taken and is
now universally approved in the case of words which once were spelled
with an initial <i>h</i>.</p>

<p>Had the users of language been always under the sway of the feelings
which have made us keep the <i>k</i>, no small number of common words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
which now begin with <i>l</i>, <i>n</i>, or <i>r</i> would have these
letters preceded by the aspirate. So they were at first. This class
may be represented by <i>ladder</i> and <i>lot</i>, the originals
of which were <i>hlædder</i> and <i>hlot</i>; by <i>neck</i> and
<i>nut</i>, originally <i>hnecca</i> and <i>hnut</i>; by <i>ring</i>
and <i>roof</i>, originally <i>hring</i> and <i>hrôf</i>. The letter
<i>h</i>, having disappeared from the pronunciation, our fathers
dropped it from the spelling. The most ardent devotee of derivation
as a guide to orthography would now be unwilling to restore it. The
same men who would be horrified at the idea of dropping <i>k</i> from
<i>knoll</i> and <i>knife</i>, because that letter or its equivalent
is found in the original, would be equally horrified at the thought
of restoring <i>h</i> to <i>loud</i> and <i>nap</i> and <i>raven</i>,
though in all of them it once flourished. It is simply another
illustration of the same old sham of invoking derivation to resist any
change in the spelling to which we are accustomed, and of disregarding
it, and even defying it, when we are asked to carry out our professed
principles by altering the spelling so as to bring it into accordance
with them.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>There is still another objection to be considered. We are given to
understand that difference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span> of spelling is quite essential to the
recognition of the meaning of words pronounced alike. Otherwise
there would be danger of misapprehension. This is a point upon which
Archbishop Trench insisted strongly. He discovered that great confusion
would be caused by writing alike words which have the same sound when
heard, but are distinguished to the sight. Such, for illustration,
are <i>son</i> and <i>sun</i>, <i>rain</i> and <i>reign</i> and
<i>rein</i>. This is one of those difficulties which are very
formidable on paper, but nowhere else. It is what comes to men of
learning from looking at language wholly from the side of the eye and
not at all from that of the ear. In the controversy that went on in
this country in consequence of the President’s order, I noticed that in
a certain communication an old friend of mine specified me personally
as one setting out to destroy what he called sound English by arranging
letters in a totally different way, and thereby seeking to reconstruct
the language to its destruction. Naturally, he was indignant at the
nefarious attempt, though had he stopped to consider the disproportion
between the pettiness of the puny agent and the massiveness of the
mighty fabric, there would have appeared little reason for much
excitement. Personally, so far from feeling resentment at his words, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
read them with even more amazement than sorrow. The argument he used is
of the sort which I expect to find communicated to the press by that
noble army of the ill-informed who are always rushing to the rescue of
the English language from the reckless practices of those who do not
use it with their assumed accuracy or spell it according to their ideas
of propriety. But here the objection came from a real scholar.</p>

<p>His words were, therefore, a convincing argument for the necessity
of reform. They revealed in a striking way the bewildering effect
our orthography exercises over the reasoning powers. He wanted to
know what the phonetists—they deserve that name, he told us—are
going to do with words alike in sound but different in sense. He
began with <i>ale</i> and <i>ail</i>. It might have been inferred
from his argument that, unless <i>ail</i> and <i>ale</i> were spelled
differently, no person could ever be quite certain whether he were
suffering from the one or partaking of the other. Another of his
instances was <i>bear</i> and <i>bare</i>. Does anybody, on hearing
either of these words, hesitate about its meaning? Why should he, then,
when he sees it, even if both were spelled the same way? Or again, take
the noun <i>bear</i> by itself. If any one comes across it, does he
suffer much perplexity in ascertaining whether it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span> the bear of the
wilderness or the bear of Wall Street that is meant?</p>

<p>This last example, indeed, exposes of itself the utter futility of
this argument. There is an indefinite number of words in the language
which have precisely the same form as nouns or verbs. The fact that
they belong to different parts of speech never creates the slightest
confusion. Furthermore, there are but few common words in the language
which are not used in different senses, often in many different
senses, sometimes in widely different senses. Does that fact cause
any perceptible perplexity in the comprehension of their meaning? Do
reporters, who must arrive at the sense through the medium of the
ear, experience any difficulty in ascertaining what the speaker is
trying to say? Does any one in any relation of life whatever? When a
man is returning from a voyage across the Atlantic, is he bothered
by the different significations of the same term when he is trying
to ascertain whether it is his duty to pay a duty? When one meets
the word <i>piece</i>, does he suffer from much embarrassment in
determining whether it means a part of something, or a fire-arm, or a
chessman, or a coin, or a portion of bread, or an article of baggage,
or a painting, or a play, or a musical or literary composition?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span> Does
any one experience trouble, on hearing a sentence containing the word
<i>thick</i>, in determining whether it is an adjective or a noun, or
whether it denotes ‘dense,’ or ‘turbid,’ or ‘abundant,’ or a measure
of dimension? Given the connection in which it is employed, does any
one mistake <i>rain</i> for <i>reign</i> or <i>rein</i>? The negative
answer which must be made to such questions as these disposes at once
of a difficulty that has no existence outside of the imagination.</p>

<p>In fact, language presents not merely many examples of words with
the same spelling which have different meanings, but sometimes of
those that have exactly opposite meanings. Yet that condition of
things produces no confusion. Does any one hesitate about what course
to pursue when told, on the one hand, to “stand fast” or on the
other to “run fast?” Does he ever in actual life confound the word
<i>cleave</i>, when it means to adhere with the <i>cleave</i> which
means to destroy adherence by splitting? When you dress a fowl, you
take something off it or out of it; when you dress a man, you put
something on him. Or take an example which may fairly be considered
as presenting a certain obscurity at the first glance. In his ode on
the morning of Christ’s Nativity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span> Milton tells us that “Kings sate
still with awful eye.” Here <i>awful</i> does not have the sense, most
common with us, of ‘inspiring awe,’ but the strictly etymological one
of ‘full of awe.’ Yet no one proposes to indicate by difference of
spelling a difference of signification, the ascertainment of which
depends not on the sight but on the brain. In truth, if no trouble is
experienced in determining the meaning of words sounded alike in the
hurry of conversation, when the hearer has but a moment to compare
the connection and comprehend the thought, it is certainly borrowing
a great deal of unnecessary anxiety to fancy that embarrassment could
be caused in reading, where there is ample opportunity to stop and
consider the context and reflect upon the sense which the passage must
have. The actual existence of any such difficulty would imply an innate
incapability of comprehension which, were it even justified by the
individual consciousness of the asserter, it would be manifestly unfair
to attribute to the whole race.</p>

<p>It needs but a moment’s consideration to perceive the worthlessness
of this argument. Yet let us put ourselves in the place of those who
advance it, and treat it as if it had some weight. Let us assume that
if words having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span> the same pronunciation are spelled alike, a confused
apprehension would be produced in the reader’s mind. But are these
believers in man’s impenetrable stupidity willing to carry out the
doctrine they profess to its logical conclusion? For the sake of
preventing this assumed confused state of mind, are they willing to
change the spelling of words which have precisely the same form but
a pronunciation distinctly different? It will be found that the very
men who clamor for the retention of different spellings for words
pronounced alike are just as insistent upon the retention of words
with similar spellings which are pronounced unlike. Of these there is
a very respectable number in our tongue. Especially is this true of
verbs and substantives which have precisely the same form on paper, but
a different pronunciation. We <i>lead</i>, for example, an expedition
to discover a <i>lead</i> mine. A <i>tarry</i> rope may cause us to
<i>tarry</i>. This inconsistency of attitude is necessarily more marked
in words belonging to the same part of speech. In consequence, a burden
is imposed upon the learner of mastering a distinction which, in a
language sensibly spelled, would be ashamed to put in a plea for its
existence. <i>Slough</i>, ‘a miry place,’ has as little resemblance
in sound as in meaning to <i>slough</i>, ‘the cast-off skin of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
serpent.’ We indicate the <i>tear</i> in our eyes and the <i>tear</i>
in our clothes by words which have little likeness of sound, but have
the same spelling in the written speech. We could go on enumerating
examples of this sort; but to what end? It is maintained, according to
the theory enunciated in the case of <i>ail</i> and <i>ale</i>, that
a distinction of form in these and similar words ought to be insisted
upon so that the reader may discover without effort which one is meant.
But the application of this very argument would be at once scouted
were an attempt made to extend the principle to words spelled alike
but pronounced differently. This is but another of the numberless
inconsistencies in which the opponents of reform find themselves
plunged when they attempt to stand up for the existing orthography on
the ground of reason.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>So much for an objection which, if not serious in itself, has to many
a serious look. There has been another brought forward which is so
baseless, not to call it comic, that nothing but the sincerity of those
adducing it would justify its consideration at all. It is to the effect
that, were there any thorough reform of the spelling,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span> all existing
books would be rendered valueless. Owners of great libraries, built
up at the cost of no end of time and toil and money, would see their
great collections brought to nought. The rich and varied literature of
the past could no longer be easily read; it would have to wait for the
slow work of presses to transmit it to the new generation in its modern
form. Such is the horrible prospect which has been held before our
eyes. The view would be absurd enough if directed against thoroughgoing
phonetic reform. But as against the comparatively petty changes
which are proposed and which alone stand now any chance of adoption,
language is hardly vituperative enough to describe its fatuousness.
But as in the discussion of this question we have to deal largely with
orthographic babes, it is desirable to pay it some slight attention.</p>

<p>For the purpose of quieting the fears which have been expressed, it
is necessary to observe that change of anything established, even
when generally recognized as for the better, is not accomplished
easily. Therefore, it is not accomplished quickly. It never partakes
of the nature of a cataclysm. For its reception and establishment
it requires regular effort, not impulsive effort; it requires labor
prolonged as well as patient. It took, for instance, many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span> scores of
years to establish the metric system wherever it now prevails, with
all the power of governments behind it. When the change made depends
upon the voluntary action of individuals it must inevitably be far
slower. Any reform of spelling in English speech which is ever proposed
must stretch over a long period of years before it is universally
adopted. There will consequently be ample time for both publishers and
book-owners to set their houses in order before the actual arrival of
the impending calamity.</p>

<p>This is on the supposition that it can be deemed a calamity to either.
There is actually about it nothing of that nature. The process deplored
is a process which is going on every day before our eyes. There is not
an author of repute in our literature of whose works new editions are
not constantly appearing in order to satisfy a demand which the stock
on hand does not supply. Few, comparatively, are the instances in which
a classic English writer is read in editions which came out during his
lifetime. This is true even of those who flourished as late as the
middle of the last century. How many are the people who read Thackeray,
Dickens, and Macaulay in books which appeared before the death of these
authors? If there is any demand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span> for their works, these are constantly
reprinted and republished. But the appearance of the new book does not
lower the value of the old, if it be really valuable. If it be not, if
the edition supplanted is of an inferior character or has been merely a
trade speculation, it has already served its purpose when it has paid
for itself. Under any conditions it can be trusted to meet the fate it
deserves.</p>

<p>So much for the point of view of booksellers and book-owners. As
regards book-readers, the fear is just as fatuous. Few, again, are the
men who read works of any long repute—naturally the most valuable
works of all—in the spelling which the author used who wrote them
and in which the publisher first produced them. It is not because the
difference in this respect between the present and the past breeds
dislike. On this point the book-market furnishes incontrovertible
testimony. Valuable works which are printed in an orthography different
from that now prevailing do not decrease in price at all. On the
contrary, they steadily rise. This is a fact which the impecunious
student, in search of early editions, learned long ago, not to his
heart’s content, but to its discontent. The increase in value renders
them difficult for him to procure. Does the difference of spelling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
render them difficult to decipher? A single example will suffice to
settle that point. At the present moment there lies before me the first
edition of the greatest English satire to which the strife of political
parties has given birth—the <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i> of John
Dryden. It was published in November, 1681. To purchase it now would,
under ordinary circumstances, take far more money than it would to buy
the best and completest edition of the whole of Dryden’s poems. It
consists of ten hundred and twenty lines of rhymed heroic verse. The
number of different words it contains may be guessed at from that fact;
it has never, to my knowledge, been determined. But the words which are
spelled differently in it from what they are now are just about two
hundred.</p>

<p>This first edition itself presents certain characteristics of spelling
so alien to our present orthography that it suggests that those now
desiring change in it need not necessarily be put to death as having
plotted treason against the language. In truth, the examination of
this one poem, as it originally appeared, would destroy numerous
beliefs which ignorance has created and tradition handed down and
superstition has come to sanctify. A few of the facts found in it
may be worth recounting for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span> benefit of those who fancy that
forms now prevailing have descended to us from a remote past. Among
the two hundred variations from the now prevalent usage are the past
participles <i>allowd</i>, <i>bard</i>, <i>confind</i>, <i>coold</i>,
<i>enclind</i>, <i>faild</i>, <i>shund</i>, <i>unquestiond</i>, and
<i>banisht</i>, <i>byast</i>, <i>impoverisht</i>, <i>laught</i>,
<i>opprest</i>, <i>pact</i>, <i>puft</i>, <i>snatcht</i>. We have also
<i>red</i> as a preterite and <i>sed</i> as a participle. Further, not
only is <i>could</i> most frequently spelled <i>coud</i>, which is
etymologically right, but there also appears <i>shoud</i>, which is
phonetically nearer right but is etymologically wrong. <i>Woud</i>,
indeed, is distinctly preferred to <i>would</i>, the former being found
ten times, the latter but once. <i>Monarch</i> occurs as <i>monark</i>,
<i>mould</i> as <i>mold</i>, <i>whole</i> and <i>wholesome</i> as
<i>hole</i> and <i>holsom</i>. <i>Scepter</i> is also the form found,
and not <i>sceptre</i>. In the case of several words there are still
not unfrequent those variant spellings which were common before the
printing-house had established our present uniformity, or, rather,
approach to uniformity. There is variation in the <i>or</i>, <i>our</i>
forms with, on the whole, a distinct preference for the latter, as
might have been expected when the influence of the French language and
literature was predominant. <i>Labor</i>, for instance, as a noun or
verb, occurs full two dozen times. In every instance it is spelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
<i>labour</i>. So also in the same way are found <i>authour</i>,
<i>emperour</i>, <i>inventour</i>, <i>oratour</i>, <i>superiour</i>,
<i>successour</i>, <i>tutour</i>, and <i>warriour</i>. Not the
slightest hint of these and such like facts can be gathered from
editions now current. This single illustration brings out strongly
the practice of the modern publisher in printing the writings of the
great authors of the past, not in the orthography they themselves
employed but in that which recent custom has chosen to set up in its
place. Still, with all these differences just mentioned, and others not
specified, the most unintelligent opponent of spelling reform would
experience no difficulty whatever in reading the poem.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Another objection remains to be considered. It is not really directed
against any proposals made by any organized bodies which have taken up
the consideration of the subject. These, to use the distinction already
specified, devote themselves to reform <i>in</i> English orthography
and not to reform <i>of</i> it. This latter is the object aimed at by
individuals and not by societies. Consequently, this objection does not
strictly concern the plans for simplification now before the public.
It is really directed against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span> far wider-reaching reform which
would aim to render the spelling phonetic. It is regarded by some
as so crushing that I have deferred its consideration to the last.
It may be summed up in a few words. Variations of sound are almost
numberless. They cause a marked difference of pronunciation among
individuals, a more marked difference between different parts of the
same country. Furthermore, they are often so delicate as almost to defy
representation. You could not denote them if you would; and if you
could, you would be encumbered, rather than aided, by the multiplicity
of signs. It is impossible, therefore, to have our tongue spelled
phonetically, because it is pronounced differently by different persons
equally well educated. Whose pronunciation will you adopt? That is
the point which has first to be determined. It is safe to say that it
is one which can never be determined satisfactorily. That fact is of
itself decisive of the matter in dispute.</p>

<p>This view of the question at issue is triumphantly put forward as
one which can never be successfully met. Assuming for the sake of
the argument that it is a genuine objection, let us look at what it
involves. The very result of the lawlessness of our present orthography
is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span> given as the reason why no attempt should be made to bring it under
the reign of law. It is a real maxim in morals, and a theoretical one
in jurisprudence, that an offender has no right to take advantage
of his own wrong. This is the very course, however, which opponents
of change recommend for adoption. Our orthography has rendered the
orthoepy varying and doubtful. No one can tell from the spelling of a
word how it ought to be pronounced. The result is that it is pronounced
differently by different men. Accordingly, there should be no attempt
to reduce the orthography to order, because the uncertainty which has
been fastened upon it by the pronunciation has rendered it impossible
to ascertain what it really ought to be.</p>

<p>But it never seems to occur to those who advance this argument that
difficulties of the sort here indicated are not experienced in
languages which for all practical purposes are phonetically spelled,
such as Italian and Spanish. Even German can be included, because its
variations from the normal standard do not extend to the great source
of our woes, the arbitrary and different sounds given to the vowels
and combinations of vowels. But take, for example, the first mentioned
of these tongues. Its pronunciation differs in different parts of the
country.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span> In some cases the variation is very distinctly marked. Yet,
while the spelling remains the same, no embarrassment follows of the
kind indicated. If this simple fact had been taken into consideration,
it would at once have disclosed the nature of the imaginary strength
and actual weakness of this supposedly crushing argument.</p>

<p>For of all the hallucinations that disturb the mental vision of the
advocates of the existing orthography, this is perhaps the most dismal
as it is the most unreal. No phonetically spelled tongue ever has or
ever would set out to record the varying shades of the pronunciation
of any country, still less the varying shades of the pronunciation
of individuals. A system which indicates the delicate distinction of
sounds characterizing the speech of different regions resembles the
chemist’s scales, which detect the variation in weight of filaments
of hair to all appearance precisely alike. Instrumentalities of
this nature phoneticians may need and use in order to represent the
slightest diversities of pronunciation. They can and do get up for
their own guidance characters conveying differences even of intonation.
But these the ordinary speaker does not require at all. Instead
of benefiting him, they would be in his way. For the average man,
even of highest cultivation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span> it is no more important that shades
of pronunciation should be denoted in his alphabet than it would be
important for him to lug about in all temperatures and in all climates
an astronomical clock with a compensation pendulum. What any working
phonetic system would set out to do is to give those broad and easily
recognizable characteristics of educated utterance which are sufficient
to indicate to the hearer what the speaker is aiming to say. It would
represent a norm sufficiently narrow of limit to make understood
what is said, and sufficiently broad to offer within justifiable
bounds ample opportunity for the play of individual or territorial
peculiarities. Its principal effect would be to set up a standard which
would be ever before the eyes of men.</p>

<p>In truth, the comparison just made is sufficient of itself to lay
this ghastly specter of an argument which haunts so persistently
the imagination of many opponents of phonetic spelling. It is with
our pronunciation as with our timepieces. None of our watches run
precisely alike. Few if any can be called unqualifiedly correct. For
all that, with the aid of these imperfect and never precisely agreeing
instruments, we manage to transact with little friction and delay the
daily business of a life in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span> we have constantly to wait upon one
another’s movements. So, in the matter of sounds, a phonetic alphabet
would denote only those clearly recognizable distinctions which are
apparent to the ear of ordinary men. Orthography based upon such an
alphabet would assume as the very foundation upon which to build itself
the existence of a recognized standard orthoepy. It is that alone
which the spelling would represent. Provincial speakers in consequence
would have always before their eyes in the form of the word its exact
and proper pronunciation. By it they would be able to compare and if
necessary to correct their own.</p>

<p>But we may be told that while a standard time actually exists, a
standard pronunciation does not. Consequently, no phonetic spelling
can be established which will be regarded by any large portion of the
general public as satisfactory. The all-sufficient answer to this
objection is that the very thing which it is said cannot be done has
been already done and done many times. It has been done, too, in the
face of the very objection that it could not be done at all. The proof
of this statement lies in the existence of the pronouncing dictionary.
Works of this nature did not appear until the latter part of the
eighteenth century. Before they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span> appeared the project of producing them
was criticised with extreme severity. They were denounced as irrational
of nature and as impossible of execution. The same arguments, assumed
to be convincing, were produced against them as those just considered
against uniform phonetic spelling. Doctor Johnson brought the artillery
of his ponderous polysyllables to bear upon them. He proved—at least,
to his own satisfaction—the utter futility of Sheridan’s scheme of
preparing a work of this nature. His argument was based entirely on
the ground of the wide differences prevailing in pronunciation. In
spite of these arguments pronouncing dictionaries were prepared. At
a comparatively early period several appeared in rapid succession.
They are now so thoroughly established in the affections of us all
that were a dictionary to leave out this characteristic it would
cease to have consideration and sale. But a work of such sort goes
upon the assumption that there is a standard pronunciation. Otherwise
it would have no justification for its own existence. Its compilers
seek to ascertain and represent this standard. A word, indeed, may be
and not unfrequently is pronounced differently by different classes
of educated men. In that case both or all sounds of it will be
recognized—at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span> least, until such time as one has come to prevail over
the other or over all others. The pronouncing dictionary was indeed a
necessity of the situation. It was called by Archbishop Trench “the
absurdest of all books.” On what ground it can be called absurd by
an advocate of the existing orthography it is hard to determine. It
is, without doubt, a clumsy substitute for phonetic spelling. It is
not for him, however, who protests against such spelling to denounce
the aid to correct pronunciation, imperfect as it may be, which has
been rendered absolutely essential by the general prevalence of the
beliefs he accepts and defends. Had pronouncing dictionaries not come
to exist, the divergence which has been going on between spelling
and pronunciation in consequence of our lawless orthography would
have rapidly extended with the extension of the language and with the
increasing number of those who came to speak it, dwelling as they do
in regions far apart. Diversities of pronunciation would have been
sure to spring up in such a case even among the educated classes, to
say nothing of those prevailing in classes of different social grades
living almost in contact. As a matter of fact such do spring up now.
They must necessarily continue to spring up in a language<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span> where the
spelling is not under the sway of phonetic law. But they are reduced
to the lowest possible terms, in consequence of the wide use of
pronouncing dictionaries. Between the authorizations of these there are
at times divergences, but the agreements are far more numerous than
the divergences. Hence, the authorizations are sufficient to keep the
language fairly uniform. Furthermore, these works bring out clearly
the truth of the statement with which this chapter began: that every
speaker of English has to learn two languages. In dictionaries, the one
he reads and writes is given the place of honor on the printed page. To
it he turns whenever for any purpose he wishes to consult its meaning.
Following after it, whenever the word is not itself phonetically
spelled, is the form of it, usually in parentheses, as it is heard from
the lips of men. To this he turns for its pronunciation.</p>

<p>No project is entertained by any organized body to establish phonetic
spelling. It can hardly be said to exist outside of dictionaries.
These have to employ it or some approach to it in order to convey to
the users of language a conception of the proper pronunciation which
the form itself does not indicate. The discussion of the subject
is, therefore, an academic question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span> rather than a practical one.
But this it is desirable to say about it. Phonetic spelling is not
a destructive but a conservative agency. Just as the creation of
literature holds a language fast to its moorings, just as it renders
it stable by arresting all speedy verbal or grammatical change, so the
establishment of phonetic spelling would operate upon orthoepy. The
exact pronunciation would be imposed upon the word by its very form.
No one could mistake it, no one would be tempted to disregard it. From
it there would never be variation save when a change in the sound
imperatively demanded a change in the spelling to indicate it. This is
a counsel of perfection which we can recognize as desirable, but need
never expect—at least, in our day—to see realized. None the less can
we discern the benefits that would result from it. Had it existed with
us, the wide degradation of that sound of a which is represented in
<i>father</i> and <i>far</i> could not have gone on at the rapid rate
it has done in this country. There are districts in the United States
where even the following <i>l</i> does not protect it, and <i>calm</i>,
for illustration, is made to ryme with <i>clam</i>. Did phonetic
spelling exist in the mother country, the pronunciation of <i>a</i>
almost like “long <i>i</i>”—as, for example, <i>late</i>, which by
American ears is apt to be mistaken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span> for <i>light</i>—now so prevalent
in London and apparently extending over England, could never have held
its ground, even with those who had received but a limited education.
With an orthography which has no recognizable standard of correct
usage, degradations of this sort are always liable to occur; nothing,
in fact, can keep them from occurring.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br><span class="small">THE FINAL CONSIDERATION</span></h2></div>


<p>There remains one final consideration. No one who has had the patience
to examine dispassionately the facts contained in the preceding
chapters can have failed to recognize the loss of time and waste of
effort which the acquisition of our present orthography involves.
Beside these, the needless squandering of money it causes, though a
subject of just complaint, seems to me, after all, of slight account.
But even evils of this sort, great as they unquestionably are, yield
in importance to one far greater. In truth, it is not because of the
waste of time in education—harmful as that unquestionably is—that
our present orthography is peculiarly objectionable. It is the direct
influence the acquisition of it exerts in putting the intellectual
faculties to sleep at the most active period of life. Learning to spell
is, with us, a purely mechanical process. As a mental discipline it is
as utterly valueless as mere memorizing, where the student does not
understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span> what he is repeating. Like that, it is also a positive
intellectual injury. At the very outset of his school life the child is
introduced into a study in which one natural and most important process
in education, that of reasoning from analogy, is summarily suppressed.
He finds at once, because the sound in one word is represented in
one way, that it does not follow, as it ought, that in the next word
he comes to it will be represented the same way. On the contrary,
he finds it denoted by an entirely different combination of letters
for no reason which he can possibly discover. It accordingly never
enters his head that a sign, whether consisting of a single letter or
a digraph, represents a particular sound and strictly ought never to
represent but one. For him it can and usually does represent any one
of half-a-dozen. This of itself tends to deprive him of the possession
of all knowledge of the number and value of the sounds belonging to
our speech. Unfortunately such a result is not the worst. The far more
serious injury caused is the influence exerted upon the mind by the
prohibition which the acquiring of our present orthography succeeds in
imposing upon the exercise of the reason.</p>

<p>We can get some glimpse of the havoc<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span> wrought to the reasoning powers
by considering a single one of hundreds of illustrations that could
be cited. At the very outset of his study the child is given, for
example, the words <i>bed</i> and <i>red</i> to spell. If he has been
properly trained up to this point, the limited acquaintance he has
made with the values of letters leads him to say <i>b-e-d</i> and
<i>r-e-d</i>. These are pure phonetic spellings. They satisfy all the
conditions. Then he is introduced to the word <i>head</i>. Reasoning
from analogy, he proceeds to spell it <i>h-e-d</i>. But here authority
steps in and directs him to insert another letter for which neither he
nor his instructor can see the use. Then the word <i>bead</i> is shown
him. Following the analogy of <i>head</i>, he naturally pronounces
it <i>bĕd</i>. Once more authority steps in and directs him to give
the combination <i>ea</i> another and quite distinct sound. Next,
he is presented with the infinitives and presents, <i>read</i> and
<i>hear</i>. Conforming to the example just given, and perceiving it
to be satisfactory, he fancies that he has reached at last a secure
haven. He finds his error when he meets the preterites of these two
verbs. Both have the same vowel combinations as the present. One of
them has precisely the same form. But he discovers that <i>read</i> of
the preterite has quite a distinct pronunciation from <i>read</i> of
the present,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span> and that the <i>ea</i> of <i>heard</i> has still another
sound, distinct from that of either, to which he has not yet been
introduced.</p>

<p>This condition of things is one which in numerous cases cannot easily
be remedied, owing to the lawlessness prevailing in our representation
of sounds. For the present, therefore, it may have to stand. But let
us take up one or two cases where irrationality now prevails, and yet
where a rational change can be made easily. It would, for instance,
assuredly seem hard for a being who possesses intellect enough to be
lost or saved to pretend that he sees any reason why the plural of
words ending in <i>o</i> should end sometimes with simple <i>s</i> and
sometimes with <i>es</i>. Occasionally they have both terminations,
according to the fancy of the individual writer. For illustration, the
plurals of <i>grotto</i>, <i>halo</i>, <i>memento</i>, <i>motto</i>,
and <i>negro</i> are spelled by some authors with <i>os</i> and by
others with <i>oes</i>. In the case of <i>hero</i>, the latter ending
has become the one regularly employed. This is probably due to the
fact that the singular once ended in <i>e</i>. Discarded from that,
it has transferred its unnecessary existence to the plural. As the
large majority of these words never had the <i>e</i> as a termination,
there seems not to be the slightest excuse on the ground either of
derivation or pronunciation for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span> inserting anywhere in the inflection
the unnecessary letter. On the other hand, there seems every reason for
making the spelling of the termination of this class of words uniform.
Yet men will be found to insist in imposing upon the learner the task
of mastering a distinction which serves no other purpose than to defy
analogy and insult common sense.</p>

<p>Or take another sort of trouble which adds its burden to early
education and contributes its share to the impairment of the reasoning
powers. In the case of certain words the child is censured if he
leaves a letter out. In the case of other words of precisely the same
character and origin he is censured if he puts it in. He is asked,
for example, to spell the conjunction <i>till</i>. The men who first
employed the word had no use for but one <i>l</i>. They therefore
did not double it. Now if the child spells it, as did his remote
ancestors, with a single <i>l</i>, he is blamed; but when he comes to
its compound <i>until</i>, he is blamed again if he spells it with two
<i>l’s</i>. If such differences of form served any purpose whatever,
some justification might be pleaded for their maintenance. But nothing
of the sort do they do. They simply heap up the burden of useless or
rather harmful knowledge with which children are compelled to load
their memory in defiance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span> of their reason. Time which should be spent
in learning something valuable in itself, and therefore permanently
profitable, is now wasted in mastering empty distinctions in the
external representation of words which have no distinction in reality,
but are reckoned conventionally of the first importance.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that in circumstances like these the child should
speedily infer that it is of no benefit to him to make use of what
little reasoning power he has been enabled to acquire? He must force
himself to submit blindly to authority, which compels him to accept as
true what he feels to be false. Now, authority in education is a good
as well as a necessary thing when its dictates are based upon reason.
But when they are not, when in truth they are defiant of reason, no
more pernicious element can well enter into the training of the young.
Doubtless the logical processes employed in other studies correct in
time for most of us the mental twist thus imparted in childhood. But it
is not always corrected. We have only to read certain of the arguments
advanced against spelling reform to become aware that the faculty of
reasoning on this subject which has been muddled in childhood is apt to
remain muddled the rest of one’s life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span></p>

<p>One illustration will bring out pointedly the truth of this last
assertion. There is frequent complaint that the children in our schools
spell badly. In this there is nothing new. It is a charge which has
been made in every generation since spelling assumed the abnormal
importance which has been imparted to it by modern devotion. In the
sense in which it is often understood the complaint has no foundation
in fact. Children spell just as well now as they did a generation
or generations ago. If anything—persons of different periods, but
belonging to the same class being alone taken into consideration—the
proportion of so-called good spellers will pretty certainly be found
larger now than ever before. But there always has been, and so long as
our present absurd orthography continues there always will be, a goodly
number of persons by whom it will never be thoroughly acquired. By many
a respectable mastery of it will not be gained till a comparatively
late period in their education. All this, too, in spite of the fact
that in the popular mind correctness of spelling has assumed an
exceptional importance. A man can blunder in his statement of facts;
he can lay down false premises and draw from them the absurdest
conclusions; he can exhibit incompetence and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span> inconsequence in the
discussion of matters important or unimportant—yet none of these
gross manifestations of ignorance and incapacity will bring him so
much discredit in the eyes of many as the inability to spell certain
common words properly. There is something even worse than this. In many
communities a man may be a drunkard or a libertine with far less injury
to his reputation than the disclosure of the fact that he is unable to
spell correctly.</p>

<p>This state of feeling has imparted to spelling a factitious importance
in modern education. But it involves further an inconsistency in the
course of many of the stoutest defenders of the present orthography.
These are often seeking to reconcile things which are incompatible. No
more frequent attacks are made upon the system of education prevalent
in our higher institutions of learning than the stress they are
supposed to lay upon the cultivation of the memory instead of the
reason. Now, if there be any truth in this accusation, the course
adopted is nothing more than an extension to the advanced student of
the very processes which are used in the instruction of the child. In
learning to spell, his memory is developed not merely in place of the
reason, but too often in defiance of it. Yet in nineteen cases out
of twenty it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span> be found that the very persons who indulge in the
most lugubrious lamentations about the subordination of the reason to
the memory in the educational processes employed in our universities,
are the ones who insist most strongly upon the retention of an
orthography which tends inevitably to produce the very effect they
profess to deplore. In one breath they complain of the poor spelling
of the students in our schools and colleges. In the next breath they
object to any alterations which would bring order where now all is
inconsistency and confusion; to changes of any sort which would make
English orthography approach nearer rationality, and, therefore, easier
to acquire. Is it not fair to consider this attitude on their part a
direct result of that mental twist already mentioned as imparted in
childhood?</p>

<p>I do not believe myself that the English race, once fully awakened
to the exact character of English orthography, will cling forever to
a system which wastes the time of useful years, and can only exhibit
as its best educational result the development of the memory at the
expense of the reasoning powers. I do not underrate the immensity of
the obstacles which lie in the path of those who set out to accomplish
even the slightest change. There is, first and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span> foremost, the
impossibility of effecting, in the present state of public opinion,
any thoroughgoing and therefore completely consistent reform. In any
partial reform which can be secured there will be certain to remain
inconveniences and inconsistencies which it must be left to the future
to correct. At these the objector can always plausibly carp. But
there is something more than the difficulty inherent in the matter
itself. This is the immensity of the efforts demanded to destroy the
superstition as to the sanctity of this creation, not of scholars,
but of printers, which we call English orthography. Even to do this
preliminary work will require the time and toil of years of struggle.</p>

<p>The fact is perhaps not much to be regretted. There is nothing worth
living for that is not worth fighting for. But the task is no light
one. Not merely have ignorance and prejudice to be overcome, but, what
is far worse, stupidities, against which, the poet tells us, even
the gods fight unvictorious. The higher class of minds have, indeed,
been largely gained over. But there is little limit to the endeavor
that must be put forth before any impression can be made upon that
inert mass which prefers to remain content with any degree of error,
however great, in preference to making any attempt to correct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span> it,
however slight. Still, this is the usual experience of all movements
which aim to overthrow “the reign of ill custom”—to use Jonson’s
words—which has long prevailed. The advocates of reform of English
orthography can expect nothing different. But they can be encouraged
by the recollection that the efforts of men in the past engaged in
even harder enterprises have after long years of struggle been carried
to successful completion, because the combatants themselves have been
sustained by the hope, and have acted under the inspiration, that what
ought to be is to be.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
